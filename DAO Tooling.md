# DAOccelerate

For both DAOs and DOs

## Description:

A platform for launching, building, and maintaining DAOs

## Product Discovery

### Community Management and Engagement

Think: a mix of Circle.so and Facebook groups, with token- and NFT-based gating controls.

### Token Swap

A token swap allows someone to trade one coin for another. One of the features of the DAOccelerate platform is that it would allow DAOs to mint their own tokens and to setup either a private or a public token exchange.

**Public**

This is an open swap where anyone can exchange the denomination currency for the governance token. Token reserves are held in the swap contract for liquidity.

**Private**

In order to participate in a private token swap, the wallet that owns the contract has to add your wallet address to a list that is maintained inside the smart contract. Wallet addresses in this list are able to exchange the denomination currency for the DAO governance token (either buy or sell).

## Funding DAOccelerate

Funding based on two principles:
1. No-loss investment
2. Return on Engagement

### Phase 1: Alignment

Raise a "seed" round of funding to get things started

This seed round gets locked in to a yield-earning vault and the yield rewards are what is used to build the product. In return for contributing, "investors" are provided tokens.

Early users will be charged fees for initial setup and for transactions. These fees will be placed in a vault and farmed or staked. Over time, they will be paid back for their early contributions.

### Phase 2: Fee Reduction

As the DAO vault grows (and the yield rewards grow with it), fees paid by early users will be paid back while fees are simultaneously reduced for users. Not all fees will go to 0 (i.e. some feels will continue to ensure the DAO vault can continue to grow)

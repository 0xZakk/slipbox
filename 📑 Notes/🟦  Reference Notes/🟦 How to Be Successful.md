    - Usually, people start off wanting the former and end up wanting the latter.  
    - Here are 13 thoughts about how to achieve such outlier success. 
    - 1. Compound yourself
Compounding is magic. Look for it everywhere. Exponential curves are the key to wealth generation. 
    - You also want to be an exponential curve yourself‚Äîyou should aim for your life to follow an ever-increasing up-and-to-the-right trajectory. It‚Äôs important to move towards a career that has a compounding effect‚Äîmost careers progress fairly linearly. 
    - I think the biggest competitive advantage in business‚Äîeither for a company or for an individual‚Äôs career‚Äîis long-term thinking with a broad view of how different systems in the world are going to come together.  
    - 2. Have almost too much self-belief
Self-belief is immensely powerful. The most successful people I know believe in themselves almost to the point of delusion. 
    - Cultivate this early. As you get more data points that your judgment is good and you can consistently deliver results, trust yourself more. 
    - Managing your own morale‚Äîand your team‚Äôs morale‚Äîis one of the greatest challenges of most endeavors. It‚Äôs almost impossible without a lot of self-belief. And unfortunately, the more ambitious you are, the more the world will try to tear you down. 
    - Self-belief must be balanced with self-awareness. I used to hate criticism of any sort and actively avoided it. Now I try to always listen to it with the assumption that it‚Äôs true, and then decide if I want to act on it or not. Truth-seeking is hard and often painful, but it is what separates self-belief from self-delusion. 
    - 3. Learn to think independently
Entrepreneurship is very difficult to teach because original thinking is very difficult to teach. School is not set up to teach this‚Äîin fact, it generally rewards the opposite. So you have to cultivate it on your own. 
    - ‚ÄúI will fail many times, and I will be really right once‚Äù is the entrepreneurs‚Äô way. You have to give yourself a lot of chances to get lucky. 
    - One of the most powerful lessons to learn is that you can figure out what to do in situations that seem to have no solution. The more times you do this, the more you will believe it. Grit comes from learning you can get back up after you get knocked down. 
    - 4. Get good at ‚Äúsales‚Äù
Self-belief alone is not sufficient‚Äîyou also have to be able to convince other people of what you believe. 
    - The best way to be good at sales is to genuinely believe in what you‚Äôre selling. Selling what you truly believe in feels great, and trying to sell snake oil feels awful. 
    - My other big sales tip is to show up in person whenever it‚Äôs important. When I was first starting out, I was always willing to get on a plane. It was frequently unnecessary, but three times it led to career-making turning points for me that otherwise would have gone the other way. 
    - 5. Make it easy to take risks
Most people overestimate risk and underestimate reward. Taking risks is important because it‚Äôs impossible to be right all the time‚Äîyou have to try many things and adapt quickly as you learn more 
    - 6. Focus
Focus is a force multiplier on work. 
    - Almost everyone I‚Äôve ever met would be well-served by spending more time thinking about what to focus on.  
    - 7. Work hard
You can get to about the 90th percentile in your field by working either smart or hard, which is still a great accomplishment. But getting to the 99th percentile requires both 
    - Extreme people get extreme results. 
    - You have to figure out how to work hard without burning out. People find their own strategies for this, but one that almost always works is to find work you like doing with people you enjoy spending a lot of time with. 
    - 8. Be bold
I believe that it‚Äôs easier to do a hard startup than an easy startup. People want to be part of something exciting and feel that their work matters. 
    - 9. Be willful
A big secret is that you can bend the world to your will a surprising percentage of the time‚Äîmost people don‚Äôt even try, and just accept that things are the way that they are. 
    - People have an enormous capacity to make things happen. A combination of self-doubt, giving up too early, and not pushing hard enough prevents most people from ever reaching anywhere near their potential. 
    - To be willful, you have to be optimistic‚Äîhopefully this is a personality trait that can be improved with practice. I have never met a very successful pessimistic person. 
    - 10. Be hard to compete with
Most people understand that companies are more valuable if they are difficult to compete with. This is important, and obviously true. 
    - But this holds true for you as an individual as well. If what you do can be done by someone else, it eventually will be, and for less money. 
    - The best way to become difficult to compete with is to build up leverage. 
    - 11. Build a network
Great work requires teams. Developing a network of talented people to work with‚Äîsometimes closely, sometimes loosely‚Äîis an essential part of a great career. The size of the network of really talented people you know often becomes the limiter for what you can accomplish.
 
    - One of the best ways to build a network is to develop a reputation for really taking care of the people who work with you. Be overly generous with sharing the upside; 
    - Also, learn how to evaluate what people are great at, and put them in those roles. 
    - 12. You get rich by owning things
The biggest economic misunderstanding of my childhood was that people got rich from high salaries 
    - You get truly rich by owning things that increase rapidly in value. 
    - But somehow or other, you need to own equity in something, instead of just selling your time. Time only scales linearly. 
    - 13. Be internally driven
Most people are primarily externally driven; they do what they do because they want to impress other people. This is bad for many reasons, but here are two important ones. 
    - First, you will work on consensus ideas and on consensus career tracks. 
    - Second, you will usually get risk calculations wrong 
    - Eventually, you will define your success by performing excellent work in areas that are important to you. The sooner you can start off in that direction, the further you will be able to go. It is hard to be wildly successful at anything you aren‚Äôt obsessed with.

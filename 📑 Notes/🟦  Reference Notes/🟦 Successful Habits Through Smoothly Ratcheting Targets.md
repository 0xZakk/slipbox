## Summary:

In this article, Andy Matuschak walks through his process for setting goals and establishing habits. He finds that normal goal-setting and habit formation are plagued by a set of issues, mostly around being too brittle to survive impact with your real life. Instead, he uses a three-part process: smoothly ratcheted targets, in moving weekly windows, with teeth:

* As a goal becomes easy to accomplish, ratchet up the difficulty
* Instead of doing `X` `N` times per week, do `X` `N` times in the last 7 days
* Put skin in the game with a consequence for not reaching your weekly goal

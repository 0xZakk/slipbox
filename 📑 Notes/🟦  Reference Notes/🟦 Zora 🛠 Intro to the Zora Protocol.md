- **Highlights:**
    - Motivations and details of Zora
    - Why of Zora
        - Platforms are everywhere - they're powerful and they're bad
        - They generally dictate how people interact with the internet (and interact with each other on the internet)
        - This is especially true for creators. Platforms have created really large social graphs that force creators to play by the platform's rules
        - Zora and NFTs is about giving power back to individuals and creators
    - [[ERC-721]]
        - Standard API for ownership of NFTs on Ethereum
        - Create and transfer the ownership of digital goods on the internet
        - As of 2020: marketplaces sat on top of ERC-721, but there wasn't native monetization built into the standard. This lead to centralized marketplaces (OpenSea, SuperRare, etc) --> Lead to platform lock in and reproducing the same problem in the decentralized world
            - Lock in, platform fees, etc
        - Zora: How can we improve upon 721 to have value accrue to owners and creators of NFTs (instead of the marketplaces)
    - Zora
        - Unifying the media and the market by embedding the market inside the token
        - Zora is a protocol that builds upon the 721 standard
        - Extension of ERC-721 that embeds royalty and auction logic into the smart contract
    - Zora Market
        - Perpetual
            - Existing marketplaces have reserve prices that have to be met and the highest bidder wins
            - Zora market is perpetual. Someone can bid on it, which goes into a bid liquidity. When the creator accepts a bid, the liquidity stays in the contract unless the bidders remove it.
            - It's like transferring ownership of the order book and the NFT
        - Multi-currency
            - Any ERC 720 token can be accepted as a bid token
            - You'll see bids in lots of different tokens
        - Open 
            - Generally, the highest bidder wins
            - In Zora, the owner of the NFT has control over which bid to accept
        - Sell On Share
            - A bidder is able to create a sell on share as part of their bid
            - This is generally used in professional soccer for transferring players. When you transfer a player to another team, you can specify the sell on share. When that player gets transferred, you get a kick back
            - Creator gets a kick back on each sale of the NFT
        - Creator Share
            - Sort of like royalties - you can specify some percentage of equity that you always own of the NFT
            - Every time the NFT gets sold, the creator gets some percentage of the sale price
            - Doesn't work (yet) if someone goes and sells the NFT on a different market
        - Trustless
            - Zora is deployed as a smart contract with no privileges or admins
    - Other Updates to [[ERC-721]]
        - Decoupling of content and metadata
            - Existing standard has an optional metadata standard, includes a `tokenURI`
            - Ethereum is really bad at storing data. So most NFTs are tokens that point to the file stored somewhere (hopefully on [[IPFS]], but could be on a private server somewhere)
            - The `tokenURI` contains a reference to some JSON metadata that contains the link to the raw file
            - This feels kinda weird, so Zora split these
            - The `tokenURI` points to the actual content of the NFT, typically an IPFS hash
            - Zora adds the `tokenMetadataURI` that points to the metadata as a separate IPFS hash
            - The `tokenURI` is also updatable in Zora (which isn't the case with typical NFTs)
                - NFT includes a `contentHash` and a `metadataHash` which makes it possible to change the location of the content without changing the value of the NFT (like swapping Beeple's 500 Days for the Rick roll video)
                - The hash lets you verify that the thing you're buying is the thing created by the creator
                - zNFT Validator
                - This also lets Zora enforce content uniqueness
                    - A hash on Zora can only be minted once
                    - This ensures no fakes or copies
        - Updatable URIs
        - Hash Integrity
        - Meta Transactions
    - Building on Zora
        - Zora is open and permissionless, so anyone can build marketplaces, galleries, and other experiences on top of Zora NFTs
        - https://zora.engineering
        - Zora provides the ZDK (development kit)
        - Some projects that have been built on Zora:
            - Mirror
            - Catalog

# Explore-Exploit

## Summary:

Life presents a complex problem to everyone: what's the best way to live well with the finite time you have? What will bring you the most joy and fulfillment? What investments in will yield the highest return?

It's easy to get overwhelmed by all the possible options. Like walking into a casino and seeing rows and rows of slot machines, knowing some will have a really high return on each pull of the lever, while others will have none.

Seeing these rows and rows of slot machines, it's easy to get worried that you'll put your quarters in the wrong machine. Some people never pull a lever because of it. Others tentatively pull a few levers. Then dump all their quarters into the first machine that gives them any back. They wonder if another machine would give them more back for their time but they're too scared to find out.

When you see the rows and rows and rows of machines, just start pulling levers. Pull as many as you can, as quickly as you can. Take note when one gives you a handful of quarters back. But keep pulling new levers. When you've pulled a good number of them, go back and invest in the ones that gave you the highest return. But never stop pulling new levers.

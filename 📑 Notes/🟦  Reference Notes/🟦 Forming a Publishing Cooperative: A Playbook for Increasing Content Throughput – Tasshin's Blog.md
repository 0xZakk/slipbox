    - Like many creators, I have more ideas for projects than I have time to work on. 
    - Historically, these constraints have forced me (and my peers) to learn to prioritize, to optimize the available time, and remove distractions. 
    - Doing extended solitary retreat forced me to confront the fact that I needed to make a change in my creative process. 
    - At first, it wasn‚Äôt clear what changes I needed to make. I knew I wanted to write and publish more posts, at higher quality, with a bigger impact on the world. I didn‚Äôt know how to do that. To diagnose my situation, I asked myself a number of open-ended, exploratory questions: 
    - Asking these questions led me to investigate many possibilities for improving my creative process. But there was one clear theme: I had reached the limits of what I was capable of on my own. 
    - To realize my ambitious visions for serving the world through my writing, I would need to start working with other people. I needed a team. 
    - In this post, I‚Äôll describe the changes I‚Äôve made to my writing projects, including recruiting a group of people to support me in using my writing to have a positive impact on the world. 
    - I know many people who wish they were writing more, or putting out content of different kinds more frequently as a way to further their career, make connections, or serve the world. I believe the ideas that I share here could help you have a larger, deeper impact through your creative work. 
    - Because I had such a large backlog of posts I wanted to write, my main goal was to double my throughput for the last six months of 2020. 
    - Increasing my throughput would require me to completely overhaul my creative process. Making a change required several smaller efforts, including:

Clarifying Research Areas
Recruiting and Managing a Team
Managing Throughput
Getting Started 
    - Clarifying Research Areas 
    - Over the last several years, I‚Äôve read 20+ books about strategy. I‚Äôve done so simply by trying to always be reading one book on the topic. Reading widely within the field has helped me to get a deeper understanding of the topic than I would gain by reading just one or two books on the topic. In turn, this deeper understanding of strategy has helped me, an amateur strategist, to write about the topic in a way that even experts in the field find interesting and valuable. 
    - For my reading this year, I decided to reproduce and broaden this success by intentionally focusing all of my reading on certain key areas of interest 
    - For each of these areas, I recorded a number of research questions. 
    - Recruiting a Team 
    - Far and away, the biggest and most impactful change that I‚Äôve made has been recruiting other people to help me. I‚Äôve learned that I need several different kinds of help, which has led me to create four major roles so far within my organization: 
    - Blog Manager: 
    - While I had some idea of what he could help me with, I told him his job was to level up every aspect of how I share my writing with the world, to discover ways he could help me that I couldn‚Äôt predict or anticipate. 
    - Research Assistants: I‚Äôve asked these folks to support me in doing auxiliary research on my main topics of interest. I‚Äôve shared my research questions and notes with them, discovered a mutually-interesting area of exploration, and asked them to dive in and report back. 
    - Transcribers: these people take audio of me speaking on future blog post topics, transcribe the audio with Otter.ai, and turn the resulting transcript into a first draft of a post that I can revise further. 
    - Editors 
    - Managing a Team 
    - Managing others has required me to grow new skills and capacities as a project manager and leader. Here are some of the lessons I‚Äôve learned so far as a leader and manager: 
    - State ‚Äúpolicies‚Äù as soon as possible 
    - Use trial periods for recruitment 
    - Create procedures 
    - Managing Throughput 
    - Producing content at double my rate would require me to revisit how I tracked what I was writing. From a perspective of throughput, this is called Work in Progress (WIP), a concept I wrote about previously in Making Knowledge Work Visible 
    - When I first started tracking my writing, I used the three categories suggested as a sane default for kanban: ready, doing, done. I limited my Work in Progress by working on a maximum of four posts at a time. 
    - I broke my writing process down into ten stages in my kanban board:

Gathering Notes / Theses / Questions
Outlining
Transcribing (optional ‚Äì only for posts that start in a spoken form)
Drafting
Soliciting Content Feedback
Revising
Soliciting Editing Feedback
Final Polishing
Publishing
Distributing 
    - Getting Started 
    - To kick off this new endeavor, I took seven days of vacation time off of the monastic schedule to draft, write, edit, and publish as many posts as possible. I was inspired by Nick Winter‚Äôs concept of a Maniac Week, 
    - Applying These Ideas 
    - If you want to take some of these steps in your own writing process or other creative activity, here are a few places you might start: 
    - Ask yourself open-ended questions about your creative process, goals, and vision. What do you want to achieve? Why? 
    - Identify what areas you want to be focusing on: what topics and questions do you want to be reading and writing about? 
    - If you don‚Äôt already have one, capture all your existing ideas for creating content in a system. Tag them according to the different areas of focus you‚Äôre interested in. 
    - What is your current throughput, if any? What‚Äôs an ambitious but realistic goal for increasing your throughput? 
    - Ask for help from your friends, peers, allies, followers, and acquaintances, and find win-win ways to get the help you need while also helping others. 
    - Break your creative process down into discrete steps, track your work visually with a kanban board, and use WIP limits. Feel free to iterate on those limits over time.

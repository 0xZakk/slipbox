    - **Internet of Information**
        - This is the internet now
        - Democratized information
        - ie when I send you an email, you're actually receiving a copy
        - This doesn't work for most forms digital assets though (ie if I wire you $100, it's really important that I don't have that money anymore - the double spend problem)
    - Right now we rely on middlemen to establish trust and perform business and transaction logic
        - This is the government
        - But it's also social media tools like Facebook
        - Problems:
            - Centralized, so they can be hacked
            - Exclude people from the global economy
            - They slow things down
            - They take out a big cut
            - They capture our data and undermine our privacy
            - **They've appropriated the largess of the digital age asymmetrically, so we have incredible wealth creation, but growing social inequality.**
    - **Internet of Value**
        - Distributed ledger, available to everyone. Every asset can be stored, transacted, and exchanged without intermediaries
        - This is what Bitcoin and Blockchain are doing
        - Bitcoin is interesting, but the underlying technology is the really interesting technology
    - Blockchain
        - People everywhere can trust each other and transact peer to peer without middlemen or some big institution
        - The Trust Protocol
    - 5 ways Blockchain could be used
        - Land titles:
            - 70% of people who own land have tenuous title (meaning the land could be taken away)
            - Put land titles on a blockchain so it can't be hacked
        - Sharing economy
            - [[ðŸ“¦ Article: Sharing Economy on Blockchain]]
            - These companies (Airbnb and Uber) don't really share
            - What about a distributed Airbnb, peers are people who have rooms to rent
            - Blockchain does contracting and handles payment and even handles reputation
            - The people who "own" the company are the people who have rooms to rent
        - Remittance payments
            - People who send money back home is a $600 Billion dollar per year industry
            - Western Union costs 10% and takes 4-5 days
            - Abra, blockchain application for sending
        - Recapturing our Identities
            - Enabling citizens to own and monetize their own data
            - Data has become more valuable in many ways than oil
            - Data you leave around builds a virtual you that you don't own
            - Blockchain could bring our data back under our control
        - Compensating Content Creators
            - Mycelia Imogen Heap
            - You can put music onto a blockchain where people can listen to it and license it
            - All the access is controlled through a smart contract, so if you want to listen to it there's a smart contract for that, if you want to license it for a movie there's a smart contract for that
            - Not just song writers, but any creators of content (inventors, scientific discoveries, etc)
    - **Technology doesn't necessarily create prosperity, people do**
    - **The blockchain genie is out of the bottle (with blockchain) and giving us another chance to solve some of the world's biggest problems**

# 10 Life-changing Realizations

## Summary:

This twitter thread includes 10 **aphorism** that will change your life if you can appreciate them. The 10 realizations are:

1. Past doesn't exist in reality; it exists inside your head. 
1. There's no Karma. The concept of good and bad is a human construct; the Universe doesn't know it. 
1. There's only one thing in the Universe that's truly in your hand: your attention. Your life is a collection of thoughts you pay attention to. 
1. Everyone is living in a different world. If you put two people in the same situation, they will experience it differently. 
1. The only person who will stay with you till your last breath is *you*. 
1. Pain becomes suffering when you keep thinking about it all day long. 
1. Your desires aren't truly yours. Most of your desires are programmed inside your head by society. 
1. All of humanity's knowledge is made-up stuff; some of it is useful. 
1. True understanding > forced discipline. 
1. You experience the reality through your body, but live it inside your head.

    - A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system. – John Gall 
    - In my whole life, I have known no wise people (over a broad subject matter area) who didn’t read all the time – none, zero. You’d be amazed at how much Warren reads–and at how much I read. My children laugh at me. They think I’m a book with a couple of legs sticking out.  
    - 1. What book is most applicable right now? If I can find a book that I can start applying right now in whatever I’m dealing with, it’ll take precedence over any other heuristic. 
    - 2. Syntopical reading. If I’ve been diving into a single topic, I may try to pick up a few more works in the same category to make sure I see the problem from different angles. I find that this helps strengthen the concepts too, as I get to run an internal mock dialog between the authors of the books where they agree or disagree. 
    - 3. Books that have aged well. If the book has been out 10 years, it’s likely it might still be relevant another 10 years from now. If it’s been out for 100 years, it’s likely it’ll be around for another 100 years. 
    - 4. What discipline or topic am I weak in? I believe that at some point, optimizing for breadth in your reading to complement your depth becomes more impactful than going even deeper. 
    - As Munger puts it, accumulate the big ideas from the big disciplines. There are so many disciplines where people learn to think in different ways to solve different problems. 
    - 5. Modern translations or interpretations are not inherently bad, especially as introductions to a topic. Old is good, but can be taken too far. 
    - If you’re really into a topic, it’s silly to not go to the primary source a book or two into the topic, though. 
    - 6. What are my friends reading? If my friends have read a book, that’s a free opportunity to talk with them about it or ask them whether it fits my criteria. 
    - 7. Audiobooks for narrative, Kindle for anything else. 
    - 8. Skim the free sample of your top x books. 
    - While books are useful, the ultimate goal here is not to read books—but to learn. 
    - I would advise looking at your choosing akin to an efficient factory. You shouldn’t have massive piles of inventory in front of every machine, but rather optimize the overall throughput through the factory. 
    - Typically, I have about 3 books on the go: An Audiobook, a fiction book on the Kindle, and a non-fiction work on the Kindle. 
    - 1. Highlights. I will highlight the interesting parts of a book. 
    - I’ve experimented with summarizing a book as I go in a memory palace, and this worked out quite well. 
    - Summarize every chapter in your head. 
    - every time they’d leave a room, they should stop at the door and summarize to themselves what just happened. What did you just learn? 
    - Reading and experience train your model of the world. And even if you forget the experience or what you read, its effect on your model of the world persists. Your mind is like a compiled program you’ve lost the source of. It works, but you don’t know why. 
    - Then why are books long? 
    - First, it’s a form of spaced repetition. 
    - The second reason books are long, is that different ways of explaining an idea resonate with different people. 
    - forming new memories needs to be hard. Otherwise, how is your brain to know what to remember and what not to? 
    - 2. Converting highlights to index cards.

    - THE BIG IDEA: “If you haven’t read hundreds of books, you are functionally illiterate, and you will be incompetent, because your personal experiences alone aren’t broad enough to sustain you,” Jim Mattis writes in his new memoir, which came out yesterday. “Any commander who claims he is ‘too busy to read’ is going to fill body bags with his troops as he learns the hard way.” 
    - The book is chock full, however, of implicit and illuminating contrasts between Mattis’s management style and Trump’s. 
    - Mattis amassed a private collection of more than 7,000 books, despite deployments around the world. 
    - “Reading sheds light on the dark path ahead,” he explains. “By traveling into the past, I enhance my grasp of the present.” 
    - The way some people prepare for a marathon, Mattis challenges himself intellectually by picking some battle or area of history where he’s weak. Then he fixates on the subject and reads everything he can find until he feels like an expert. 
    - “Strategy is hard, unless you’re a dilettante. You must think until your head hurts.” 
    - Mattis argues that intellectual rigor is just as important as physical rigor to excel in his beloved corps. 
    - “This provided my lads with a mental model as we adapted to our specific mission,” he explains. “Slowly but surely, we learned there was nothing new under the sun: properly informed, we weren’t victims – we could always create options.” 
    - The book showcases a multitude of moments that an institutional insistence on studying history paid off for Mattis and his Marines. 
    - In 1991, Mattis’s battalion captured an Iraqi major who spoke English and tutored him on the way that army used “skip-echelon techniques” to cut down on staff size. In Afghanistan, a decade later, Mattis emulated this so that he could keep his staff as small as possible. He pared down a brigade that could have had a staff of over 200 to only 32, something he’s immensely proud of. 
    - “I’m an opportunistic learner,” he explains. “I may not have come up with many new ideas, but I’ve adopted or integrated a lot from others.”

# ðŸŸ¦ Five Things We Need to Know About Technological Change 

## Summary:

Neil Postman outlines five things about technological change that are often misunderstood:

1. Technological change always presents a trade-off, meaning that for every advantage it provides, there is an equal and opposite disadvantage.
2. The advantages and disadvantages of technological change are not evenly distributed. Some people win, some lose, and some experience no difference at all.
3. Every new technology has an ideology or a prejudice. Sometimes that prejudice can be hard to see. But it's effect is to change the way that people think.
4. Technological change isn't additive, it's ecological. When the printing press was invented, you didn't have old Europe with the printing press, you had a completely new and different Europe.
5. Technology becomes mythic, meaning that, after a while, we assume that it was inevitable.

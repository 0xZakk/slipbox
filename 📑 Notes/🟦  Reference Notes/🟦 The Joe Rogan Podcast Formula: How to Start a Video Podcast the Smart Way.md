- **Summary:** The best way to start a Podcast now is to do a combined-media approach with both video and audio. This approach comes with a lot of reusability and synergy. You can post the long-form episode to YouTube and every podcast platform. You can also slice up the long-form episode into multiple ~10 minute clips. You can also make you content cross-platform and post it to everything: YouTube, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.

    - I think a SMB acquisition business could be (and probably has been) built with a similar model. https://t.co/XThvz4hI7Z 
    - In response to @amlewis4's request for more detail:

Sure. Many SMBs going thru a sale need new leadership, but good talent is hard to access for these companies. Also, many potential CEOs don't want or know how to do deals; they are operators.

1/ 
    - Talent - Recruit top-caliber, but undiscovered talent seeking more autonomy, but also support from a parent group/platform.

Platform - Provide capital, market presence, brand, deal making ability.

Infrastructure - Offer great board members, back-office support in key areas

2/ 
    - Incentives - Create comp/equity packages that align incentives, offer opp to invest in other acquisitions.

For people that are entrepreneurial, but maybe to extent that they want to do something on their own and grow it from scratch, a firm could jumpstart and derisk for them.

    - Gender Feminism is the ideology that supports the theory that the only future world worth pursuing is one in which women – all women – no longer feel threatened.  By men.  And while that sounds all warm and fuzzy and noble on the surface, there are some . . . dare I say “inequities” . . . in this ideology that not only fly against the original ideals of gender equality promoted under Equity Feminism, but actively promote the idea that men are inherently bad for human society and should be . . . eliminated. 
    - Gender Feminists are seeking to re-write the game so that the other team isn’t allowed to play.  They give excellent reasons for this: men are violent, controlling, competitive, aggressive, etc. etc.  These same qualities, when viewed in women by Gender Feminists, are seen as positives.  But it’s rare for any gender feminist to say anything nice about men.  Men ARE the problem. 
    - they feel the right of women to feel secure at all times takes active precedence over Men’s Rights to do anything at any time. 
    - Feminism, to a Gender Feminist, isn’t about equality.  It’s about female exceptionalism.

    - “One of the worst pieces of advice given to women is the “love will find you when you least expect it.” There’s a variation of that theme in the Christian community with the “God’s perfect timing” concept. Love will find the single Christian woman based on a heavenly life schematic.” . . . “Frankly, the wait for love scenario is based on emotional pornography and it’s wildly unrealistic given women’s highly elevated self-esteem and expectations based on that level of self-esteem. Being a potential partner in a committed relationship requires thought and effort. It requires understanding that the attractive and available man wants the woman to bring something to the dating and relationship table. A woman with nothing to offer is a woman who will always wait.”

    - Boys learn early to watch the horizons of history to see whether or not they will become its casualties. 
    - Women often say one thing and do another, individually or collectively.  Part of that is a communication issue: women communicate to each other (and to men) in a kind of two-channel mode, in which their verbal communication conveys one message while their subtextual actions convey another.

    - Feminism failed fatherhood and terrorized fathers with the threat of divorce and loss of custody.  If there is one single unifying fact among American men – White, Black, Asian, Hispanic, Gay, Straight, Professional or Working Class – it’s the existential terror a father feels at the idea of losing a relationship with his children due to the whims of family court and their mother.  It has driven men to violence and suicide. 
    - Average Married Dad 
    - Fatherhood and career are two sides to the coin of their masculinity, and often both of those come far above dating or marriage to these men, if they are single.  If they’re married, then being a highly-active Alpha Dad includes keeping your marriage running properly, but these guys are not angsting about their failures and beating their chests because they never seem to feel fulfilled . . . they handle it the way men traditionally do, by objectifying, problem solving, and moving on to the next challenge. 
    - Building strong young men who know their own worth and value other men unashamedly is the surest way to expand and explore our masculinity.  Educating our boys so that they are not at the mercy of a system that devalues them because of their gender, where boys are taught to value their ability to commit as much or more than a girl’s ability to grant sexual access, and how to successfully stand up for themselves in the face of a hostile mating climate.  And most of all, how to be strong fathers themselves.  With or without mothers.

    - Men feel powerful lust from dominating attractive women, the same lust women feel from submitting to the domination of powerful men. But most men will never admit to this. Not because they agree with the myths of feminism, but because most will never be in a position to enjoy the sublime pleasures of dominance over women. A complete lack of acquaintance with dominating women, and a dearth of opportunity to do so, psychologically castrates weaker men until they embrace, at least in theory, the opposite of what they truly desire. The embrace of anti-desire, the dark matter of joylessness, offers respite from an otherwise unrelenting daily reminder of their sexual and romantic failure. 
    - frame control – that is, skillful management of the conversation that purposefully steers all communication toward one particular goal, i.e. a truly fulfilling sexual encounter. 
    - But there is one element of Game that Roissy and most other PUA bloggers are adamant about: men do not put up with disrespectful conduct or speech from women.

    - The PUA community within the Manosphere have frequently faulted (or at least called attention to) the widely observed feminine tendency for a woman to view things solipsistically; that is, through the perspective of how any given event or person would affect her first and foremost.  Coupled with an observed tendency (particularly in interpersonal affairs) to use emotion in place of reason when arguing her point, this combination has led to countless browbeaten Beta men getting whipsawed by an angry date for no reason he can fathom.

    - This is what I call the Emasculation Paradox.   Many men today seem to think that the legal system is set up to give all the women the power in marriage...so they'd better cede it to her to avoid upsetting her so that she doesn't take you into divorce court hell. But the paradox is that a man who understands the reality, also understands that STANDING UP FOR HIMSELF is the ONLY WAY his wife CAN respect, admire, lust and love him.   You really shouldn't worry about upsetting her. She's a woman. She gets upset as surely as the sun rises in the East. What you have to worry about, is turning into someone she doesn't respect...and patronizing her because you are afraid of her emotional state is the fastest path to losing that respect. 
    - It's women's basic biological nature to seek dominant genes for her offspring. Yet too many men beta-ize when they get married, submit to their wives as their authority figure, and even if she THINKS it's perfectly fine to be the dominant one...that she is just exercising "equality," her basic instinct is to have utter contempt for a man that she can rule. 
    - And the most important thing the Betas need to discover?  They don’t need any damn woman’s permission to take the plunge, swallow the Red Pill, and rediscover their own masculinity. 
    - To do your utmost and fail is not a masculine sin.  To fail to do your utmost is. 
    - while women control sex, men control commitment.

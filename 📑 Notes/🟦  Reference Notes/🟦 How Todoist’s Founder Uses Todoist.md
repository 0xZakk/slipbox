    - Systemist 
    - Systemist has 6 simple components 
    - 1. Take it everywhere
A productivity system is only useful if you can access it everywhere you are. 
    - 2. Capture everything
A productivity system is only useful if it captures all of the important things going on in both your personal and professional life.  
    - 3. Break it up in small tasks and make them actionable
Small tasks are easier to complete than big ones, so break big tasks into a number of smaller sub-tasks that can be completed in one hour or less. 
    - It’s also very important to make things actionable. You should be able to complete everything you have in your to-do list. Don’t keep items that you can’t complete. 
    - 4. Prioritize 
    - I use a @high_impact label on tasks that will create a high impact.  
    - use due dates to specify when I want to complete something 
    - use Todoist’s priority levels to prioritize daily tasks. 
    - 5. Get to to-do list zero daily 
    - 6. Get consistent feedback

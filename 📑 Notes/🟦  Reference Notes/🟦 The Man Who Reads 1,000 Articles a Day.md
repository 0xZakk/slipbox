    - Robert Cottrell reads 1,000 articles a day.

But the verb ‘to read’ isn’t exactly right to describe what he does. Ingest is a little bit closer. But it doesn’t quite hit it on the nose, either. Ingestion implies that what he’s doing is a mechanical, rote activity.

No, Robert Cottrell eats articles. With gusto and verve 
    - What I'm trying to do is find pieces of writing each day which are of lasting value. 
    - I’m able to read a thousand pieces of journalism a day, which I think makes me the most read person in the world.

Not the best read, mind you, but the most read. I’ve taken account of somewhere between 3 and 5 million pieces of writing over the last 10 years. 
    - I want something that’s enjoyable to read in the moment, but will also be worth reading if it turns up in three, six or 12 months’ time.

Pieces with lasting value do three things: share really interesting ideas, deploy strong arguments, and have particularly fine writing — typically in first person.

By nature, a lot of breaking news pieces will not have lasting value. 
    - Feedly aggregates 1000s of articles into one continuous stream

Feedly is an RSS reader for the iPad that aggregates all of the articles I want to read from publications I’ve selected. Currently, I’ve got about 700 RSS feeds in my Feedly — meaning it’s aggregating about 700 publications for me every day. 
    - I put quite a lot of trust in headlines, oddly enough, because I figure that headlines are written by loyal allies of the writers who are paid to find and express what is best in the piece. So if the headline writer cannot produce a compelling headline then that is a very strong indicator that there’s not much good in the piece. 
    - I can tell if something is good if it makes me say: “I hadn’t thought of that”, or, “That’s interesting”, or — and this is really important — “I like that writer.” 
    - The more I read the more I become persuaded that the real guarantee of quality in a piece is that the person who’s written it is great. That may sound like a crazy obvious thing to say — but the whole message of the publishing industry is that the publication is the guarantee of quality. 
    - The best articles start well 
    - At that point the article has to start well. If a piece does not start well then the chances are vanishingly small that it’s going to improve. 
    - Now, this sounds like an absurdly reductivist way to approach reading. Who knows what hidden treasures I’m missing? And I’m sorry about that.

But the reality is that I have to allocate my time efficiently, and the greatest efficiency seems to be in assuming that someone who writes something is going to start off with the strongest point. 
    - Robert has built an AI to help him read even more articles 
    - Last year, I began working with a computer scientist named Jeremy Davies to build a machine learning algorithm to read articles for me. 
    - Basically, what we’ve done is trained the algorithm on all of my past issues of The Browser. And we can set it to read thousands of posts that I don’t have time to read, and judge them. 
    - This ML is essentially learning to be me. It’s basically an output from the virtual Robert Cottrell. 
    - It’s still very early, but if we set it to read 1,000 articles it will return roughly 50 articles as being high quality. Of those, roughly half are going to be false positives and I'm going to look at them and think, “What's going on here?” The other half of them are going to be real. I'm going to say,“Yes — exactly, I can see why it has chosen this.”

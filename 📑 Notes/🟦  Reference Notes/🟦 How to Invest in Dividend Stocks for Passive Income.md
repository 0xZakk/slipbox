    - How to earn passive income by investing in dividend stocks - Dividend Investing
    - Earn extra cash on a monthly basis
    - Two ways to create passive income:
        - Time upfront - You invest time in order to reap the rewards later. Turn time into repeat money
        - Money upfront - You invest money. Turn money into repeat money
    - Don't have to start with a lot
    - Dividend:
        - A payment the company gives you for owning some of their stock
        - Will get paid monthly, quarterly, or annually
        - Paid out in cash
    - Why companies pay dividends:
        - Some companies do and some dont (Pepsi v Amazon)
        - Companies that reinvest the money back into the company wont pay out dividends
        - Companies that are more established; they want to attract more/new investors
    - Example:
        - Pepsi Co (PEP) - As of Jun 14, 2019
        - $132.85 per share
        - 2.98% dividend, paid quarterly
        - That works out to ~$3.82 per share
        - Per share, it's not a lot. But, if you accumulate a lot of shares over time, then you can earn a lot of passive income
    - What to look at:
        - Payout Ratio - dividends as a percentage of earnings
            - A high number is bad. Means they may not be able to sustain those dividends
        - Dividend History - what is the history of their payments
        - Look at dividend rate to growth rate
            - 6% dividend to 4% growth rate
            - 4% dividend to 6% growth rate
        - Price to Earnings Ratio
        - Earnings Per Share
    - A lot of dividend payments are seen at long-term capital gains (Check with accountant on this)
    - Think long term - accumulating a lot of shares in dividend paying stocks
    - Reinvest dividends until you've accumulated enough stocks
    - Can also use the the Vanguard dividend ETF

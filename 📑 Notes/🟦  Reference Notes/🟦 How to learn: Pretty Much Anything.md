    - 
- **Highlights:**
    - We all want to learn new things, but we often lack the motivation do do so
    - How should you learn something new?
    - Ch 1: Procrastination
        - You want to learn something new, but your brain doesn't want to
        - Learning something new stresses your brain (like building your muscle)
        - The best solution is to just start doing it
        - You'll tell yourself that you need to be in the right mood, but just move past that by getting started
        - Overtime, it'll get easier to get started
        - At some point, you'll get distracted by a quick dopamine hit. You'll need to bring yourself
    - Ch 2: How to remember what you learn
        - Your brain is made up of neurons and these neurons are connected to other neurons through synapses. Together, these create a web of connections that map what you know. Learning is the process of creating and connecting neurons.
        - You brain has billions of these neurons, so you wont run out. There isn't a limit to what you can learn, but there is a limit to the throughput (how much you can stress your brain and create new connections). So you have to give your brain rest.
        - Learning is repetition over time
        - Your brain is really good at remembering things, but it only remembers things that are important
        - Sleep is extremely important in this process. It cleans your synapses in addition to helping you form new ones
        - Exercise and social contact also helps with this
    - Ch 3: You have to do everything yourself
        - Your brain has two modes of operating:
            - Focused mode
                - Brain is focused on a single task
                - Concentration and building new connections
                - Requires no distractions so your brain can focus
            - Diffused mode
                - Brain is free to wander
                - Not so much learning something new, but more reinforcing what you learned in Focused mode
        - You aren't completely left or right brained - you shift back and forth between these
        - You will have to do it yourself - you can't learn to paint by watching someone else paint, you have to pick up a paintbrush and do it yourself
        - Learning is about doing and building synapses
    - Ch 4: It gets tough and that's how it gets easier
        - Learning something different is hard because you don't have anything to relate to it
        - You have to push through learning something until it becomes familiar to you and isn't so abstract
        - Learning to draw an eye is hard, but you can think of an eye as a marble with some cloth over it
        - The important thing is to get across the major idea and don't get lost in the details
            - Then you'll have something that is relatable
        - 
    - Ch 5: You still have to do a lot of studying
        - You have to test yourself and make it important to you
        - Try to recall and see what you learn. When you realize you don't know something as well, review it before testing yourself again
        - You have to set aside time for deliberate practice so that you don't become over-dependent on your intuition
        - Mix things up so that your brain is able to shift focus and do this over time so that the things you want to learn are reinforced
    - Ch 6: Everything is about the process
        - It's normal to procrastinate because things that are new to us are challenging. Focus on what you can learn right now and find a way to make it fun.
        - It all comes back to taking the initiative and getting started.

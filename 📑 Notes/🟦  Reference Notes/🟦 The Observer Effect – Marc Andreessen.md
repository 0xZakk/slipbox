    - The single most common question: how do you read so much? 
    - I’ve really read all the time since I was a little kid, it's been a lifelong thing.

The world's an incredibly complex and erratic place and trying to figure that out ...is kind of a lifetime occupation. 
    - The thing I've tried to do the last few years is really ‘barbell’ the inputs. I basically read things that are either up to this minute or things that are timeless...

    - So how do you go from zero to one in a new space? Where do you start? Do you go breadth first or depth first? 
    - Part of being a firm is - we get to know and talk to a lot of people. So a lot of it, honestly, is face to face conversations. Often the way you learn about something is because somebody tells you about it. 
    - I’ll often ask those people who else I can talk to or what I can read.

    - The other technique is to read a dozen books at a time.

- **Summary:** This page of the documentation explains the most important design features behind Hyperledger Fabric.  
- **Highlights:**
    - **Hyperledger Fabric Model **
    - This section outlines the key design features woven into Hyperledger Fabric that fulfill its promise of a comprehensive, yet customizable, enterprise blockchain solution:
        - Assets ‚Äî Asset definitions enable the exchange of almost anything with monetary value over the network, from whole foods to antique cars to currency futures. 
        - Chaincode ‚Äî Chaincode execution is partitioned from transaction ordering, limiting the required levels of trust and verification across node types, and optimizing network scalability and performance. 
        - Ledger Features ‚Äî The immutable, shared ledger encodes the entire transaction history for each channel, and includes SQL-like query capability for efficient auditing and dispute resolution. 
        - Privacy ‚Äî Channels and private data collections enable private and confidential multi-lateral transactions that are usually required by competing businesses and regulated industries that exchange assets on a common network.
        - Security & Membership Services ‚Äî Permissioned membership provides a trusted blockchain network, where participants know that all transactions can be detected and traced by authorized regulators and auditors. 
        - Consensus ‚Äî A unique approach to consensus enables the flexibility and scalability needed for the enterprise. 
    - **Assets **
        - Assets can range from the tangible (real estate and hardware) to the intangible (contracts and intellectual property).
        - Hyperledger Fabric provides the ability to modify assets using chaincode transactions.
        - Assets are represented in Hyperledger Fabric as a collection of key-value pairs, with state changes recorded as transactions on a [Channel](glossary.html#channel) ledger.
        - Assets can be represented in binary and/or JSON form.
    - **Chaincode**
        - Chaincode is software defining an asset or assets, and the transaction instructions for modifying the asset(s); in other words, it‚Äôs the business logic.
        - Chaincode enforces the rules for reading or altering key-value pairs or other state database information.
        - Chaincode functions execute against the ledger‚Äôs current state database and are initiated through a transaction proposal.
        - Chaincode execution results in a set of key-value writes (write set) that can be submitted to the network and applied to the ledger on all peers.
    - **Ledger Features**
        - The ledger is the sequenced, tamper-resistant record of all state transitions in the fabric.
        - State transitions are a result of chaincode invocations (‚Äòtransactions‚Äô) submitted by participating parties.
        - Each transaction results in a set of asset key-value pairs that are committed to the ledger as creates, updates, or deletes.
        - The ledger is comprised of a blockchain (‚Äòchain‚Äô) to store the immutable, sequenced record in blocks, as well as a state database to maintain current fabric state.
    - **Privacy**
        - Hyperledger Fabric employs an immutable ledger on a per-channel basis, as well as chaincode that can manipulate and modify the current state of assets (i.e. update key-value pairs).
        - Thus, channels keep transactions private from the broader network whereas collections keep data private between subsets of organizations on the channel.
        - To further obfuscate the data, values within chaincode can be encrypted (in part or in total) using common cryptographic algorithms such as AES before sending transactions to the ordering service and appending blocks to the ledger. Once encrypted data has been written to the ledger, it can be decrypted only by a user in possession of the corresponding key that was used to generate the cipher text.
    - **Security & Membership Services **
        - Hyperledger Fabric underpins a transactional network where all participants have known identities. Public Key Infrastructure is used to generate cryptographic certificates which are tied to organizations, network components, and end users or client applications. As a result, data access control can be manipulated and governed on the broader network and on channel levels. This ‚Äúpermissioned‚Äù notion of Hyperledger Fabric, coupled with the existence and capabilities of channels, helps address scenarios where privacy and confidentiality are paramount concerns.
    - **Consensus**
        - In distributed ledger technology, consensus has recently become synonymous with a specific algorithm, within a single function. However, consensus encompasses more than simply agreeing upon the order of transactions, and this differentiation is highlighted in Hyperledger Fabric through its fundamental role in the entire transaction flow, from proposal and endorsement, to ordering, validation and commitment. In a nutshell, consensus is defined as the full-circle verification of the correctness of a set of transactions comprising a block.
        - Consensus is achieved ultimately when the order and results of a block‚Äôs transactions have met the explicit policy criteria checks. These checks and balances take place during the lifecycle of a transaction, and include the usage of endorsement policies to dictate which specific members must endorse a certain transaction class, as well as system chaincodes to ensure that these policies are enforced and upheld.
        - To conclude, consensus is not merely limited to the agreed upon order of a batch of transactions; rather, it is an overarching characterization that is achieved as a byproduct of the ongoing verifications that take place during a transaction‚Äôs journey from proposal to commitment.

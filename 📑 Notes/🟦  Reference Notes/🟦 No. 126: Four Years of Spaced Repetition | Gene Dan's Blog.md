    - Actuarial exams can be a grueling process - they can take anywhere between 4 and 10 years to complete, maybe even longer. Competition can be intense, and in recent years the pass rates have ranged from 14% to a little over 50%. In response to these pressures, students have adopted increasingly elaborate strategies to prepare for the exams - one of which is spaced repetition - a learning technique that maximizes retention while minimizing the amount of time spent studying. 
    - Spaced repetition works by having students revisit material shortly before they are about to forget it again, and then gradually increasing the time interval between repetitions. 
    - As you gradually increase the intervals between repetitions, that problem transitions from being stored in short-term memory to being stored in long-term memory. Eventually, you'll be able to retain a fact for years, or possibly even your entire life. 
    - Nowadays such a strategy is assisted with software, since as the number of problems increases, it becomes increasingly difficult to keep track of what you need to review and when. 
    - having used the software for four years, I've concluded that, for the most part, it works.

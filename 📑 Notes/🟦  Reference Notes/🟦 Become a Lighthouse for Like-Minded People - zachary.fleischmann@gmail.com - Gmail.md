    - The Internet is the best tool ever built for making friends. 
    - Twitter comes alive when you start seeing it not just as a way to consume information but also as a way to meet people. 
    - When you write on Twitter, you become a lighthouse for like-minded people, especially if you have unique interests. On Twitter, you’ll find communities of people obsessed with topics like airplanes, traditional architecture, monetary theory, investing, and the economics of cities. These communities are filled with the kinds of people you’d never be able to meet in real life. The more unique your Twitter feed, the more you’ll attract like-minded people. 
    - Focus on meeting peers instead of celebrities. If you’re young, find up-and-coming people who are at your level. Share ideas. Promote each other’s work. And if you really get along, look for ways to work together. 
    - If you’re up for it, find your “10 Club” — a group of 10 people you want to work with later in life. Make sure they’re kind, ambitious, and generous. Travel with them, meet their family, and attend their weddings. This is exactly what Twitter gave me.

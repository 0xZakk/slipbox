    - ‚ÄúThis above all: to thine own self be true, and it must follow, as the night the day, thou canst not then be false to any man.‚Äù ‚ÄîWilliam Shakespeare 
    - Freud (1927), the father of psychology, divided the psyche into three parts: the id, the ego, and the superego. He saw the id as our primal, animal nature; the superego as the judgment system that society has instilled within us; and the ego as our representative to the outside world that struggles to maintain a balance between the other two powerful forces. 
    - We are only interested in your intuitive experience of what it is like to be you. We are not looking for your knowledge; we are seeking your direct experience. You see, you can‚Äôt fail at this because your ‚Äúself‚Äù is what you are, at all times and in all places. We simply need to sort it out. After all, it can get quite confusing in there. 
    - The fact is, you already know how to find yourself; you have just gotten distracted and disoriented. 
    - you spend some time observing this mental voice, the first thing you will notice is that it never shuts up. When left to its own, it just talks. 
    - The best way to free yourself from this incessant chatter is to step back and view it objectively. Just view the voice as a vocalizing mechanism that is capable of making it appear like someone is in there talking to you. Don‚Äôt think about it; just notice it. No matter what the voice is saying, it‚Äôs all the same. It doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs saying nice things or mean things, worldly things or spiritual things. It doesn‚Äôt matter because it‚Äôs still just a voice talking inside your head. In fact, the only way to get your distance from this voice is to stop differentiating what it‚Äôs saying. Stop feeling that one thing it says is you and the other thing it says is not you. If you‚Äôre hearing it talk, it‚Äôs obviously not you. You are the one who hears the voice. You are the one who notices that it‚Äôs talking. 
    - There is nothing more important to true growth than realizing that you are not the voice of the mind‚Äîyou are the one who hears it. If you don‚Äôt understand this, you will try to figure out which of the many things the voice says is really you. People go through so many changes in the name of ‚Äútrying to find myself.‚Äù They want to discover which of these voices, which of these aspects of their personality, is who they really are. The answer is simple: none of them. 
    - If you watch it objectively, you will come to see that much of what the voice says is meaningless. Most of the talking is just a waste of time and energy. The truth is that most of life will unfold in accordance with forces far outside your control, regardless of what your mind says about it. It‚Äôs like sitting down at night and deciding whether you want the sun to come up in the morning. 
    - If you spend your time hoping that it doesn‚Äôt rain tomorrow, you are wasting your time. Your thoughts don‚Äôt change the rain. You will someday come to see that there is no use for that incessant internal chatter, and there is no reason to constantly attempt to figure everything out. Eventually you will see that the real cause of problems is not life itself. It‚Äôs the commotion the mind makes about life that really causes problems. 
    - Now this raises a serious question: If so much of what the voice says is meaningless and unnecessary, then why does it even exist? The secret to answering this question lies in understanding why it says what it says when it says it. 
    - For example, in some cases the mental voice talks for the same reason that a teakettle whistles. That is, there‚Äôs a buildup of energy inside that needs to be released. If you watch objectively, you will see that when there‚Äôs a buildup of nervous, fearful, or desire-based energies inside, the voice becomes extremely active. 
    - You will notice, however, that even when you‚Äôre not particularly bothered by something, it still talks. 
    - What you‚Äôll see, if you study this carefully, is that the narration makes you feel more comfortable with the world around you. Like backseat driving, it makes you feel as though things are more in your control. You actually feel like you have some relationship with them. A tree is no longer just a tree in the world that has nothing to do with you; it is a tree that you saw, labeled, and judged. By verbalizing it mentally, you brought that initial direct experience of the world into the realm of your thoughts. There it becomes integrated with your other thoughts, such as those making up your value system and historical experiences. 
    - Take a moment to examine the difference between your experience of the outside world and your interactions with the mental world. When you‚Äôre just thinking, you‚Äôre free to create whatever thoughts you want in your mind, and these thoughts are expressed through the voice. You are very accustomed to settling into the playground of the mind and creating and manipulating thoughts. This inner world is an alternate environment that is under your control. The outside world, however, marches to its own laws. When the voice narrates the outside world to you, those thoughts are now side by side, in parity, with all your other thoughts. All these thoughts intermix and actually influence your experience of the world around you. What you end up experiencing is really a personal presentation of the world according to you, rather than the stark, unfiltered experience of what is really out there. This mental manipulation of the outer experience allows you to buffer reality as it comes in. For example, there are myriad things that you see at any given moment, yet you only narrate a few of them. The ones you discuss in your mind are the ones that matter to you. With this subtle form of preprocessing, you manage to control the experience of reality so that it all fits together inside your mind. Your consciousness is actually experiencing your mental model of reality, not reality itself. You have to watch this very carefully because you do it all the time. You‚Äôre walking outside in the winter, you start to shiver, and the voice says, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs cold!‚Äù Now how did that help you? You already knew it was cold. You‚Äôre the one who‚Äôs experiencing the cold. Why is it telling you this? You re-create the world within your mind because you can control your mind whereas you can‚Äôt control the world. That is why you mentally talk about it. If you can‚Äôt get the world the way you like it, you internally verbalize it, judge it, complain about it, and then decide what to do about it. This makes you feel more empowered. When your body experiences cold, there may be nothing you can do to affect the temperature. But when your mind verbalizes, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs cold!‚Äù you can say, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre almost home, just a few more minutes.‚Äù Now you feel better. In the thought world there‚Äôs always something you can do to control the experience. Basically, you re-create the outside world inside yourself, and then you live in your mind. What if you decided not to do this? If you decide not to narrate and, instead, just consciously observe the world, you will feel more open and exposed. This is because you really don‚Äôt know what will happen next, and your mind is accustomed to helping you. It does this by processing your current experiences in a way that makes them fit with your views of the past and visions of the future. All of this helps to create a semblance of control. If your mind doesn‚Äôt do this, you simply become too uncomfortable. Reality is just too real for most of us, so we temper it with the mind. 
    - You will come to see that the mind talks all the time because you gave it a job to do. You use it as a protection mechanism, a form of defense. Ultimately, it makes you feel more secure. As long as that‚Äôs what you want, you will be forced to constantly‚Ä¶

    - True personal growth is about transcending the part of you that is not okay and needs protection. This is done by constantly remembering that you are the one inside that notices the voice talking. That is the way out. The one inside who is aware that you are always talking to yourself about yourself is always silent. It is a doorway to the depths of your being. To be aware that you are watching the voice talk is to stand on the threshold of a fantastic inner journey. If used properly, the same mental voice that has been a source of worry, distraction, and general neurosis can become the‚Ä¶

    - Before you had your current problem, there was a different problem. And if you‚Äôre wise, you will realize that after this one‚Äôs‚Ä¶ 
    - The bottom line is, you‚Äôll never be free of problems until you are free from the part within‚Ä¶ 
    - Once you clearly see the disturbed part, then ask, ‚ÄúWho is it that sees this? Who notices this inner disturbance?‚Äù Asking this is the solution to your every problem. 
    - The process of seeing something requires a subject-object relationship. The subject is called ‚ÄúThe Witness‚Äù because it is the one who sees what‚Äôs happening. The object is what you are seeing, in this case the inner disturbance. This act of maintaining objective awareness of the inner problem is always better than losing yourself in the outer situation. 
    - This is the essential difference between a spiritually minded person and a worldly person. Worldly doesn‚Äôt mean that you have money or stature. Worldly means that you think the solution to your inner problems is in the world outside. 
    - No solution can possibly exist while you‚Äôre lost in the energy of a problem. Everyone knows you can‚Äôt deal well with a situation if you‚Äôre getting anxious, scared, or angry about it. The first problem you have to deal with is your own reaction. 
    - The only permanent solution to your problems is to go inside and let go of the part of you that seems to have so many problems with reality. 
    - If you would like to meet your roommate, just try to sit inside yourself for a while in complete solitude and silence. You have the right; it‚Äôs your inner domain. But instead of finding silence, you‚Äôre going to listen to incessant chatter: ‚ÄúWhy am I doing this? I have more important things to do. This is a waste of time. There‚Äôs nobody in here but me. What‚Äôs this all about?‚Äù Right on cue, there‚Äôs your roommate.

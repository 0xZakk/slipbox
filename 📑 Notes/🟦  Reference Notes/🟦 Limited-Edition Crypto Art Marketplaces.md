- **Summary:**
    - 
- **Literature Notes:**
    - 
- **Highlights:**
    - [[ERC-721]]
        - Token standard that lets you create unique tokens on [[Ethereum]]
        - [[ERC-720]] - identical tokens
        - [[ERC-721]] each token is unique
        - That's the key difference between these two tokens
        - Zora, Foundation, and Superrare all exist as marketplaces for buying, selling, and trading these unique tokens (like art or trading cards)
    - Marketplaces:
        - Superrare - rare NFT artwork
        - OpenSeas - all things NFTs
            - They sell art, virtual worlds, collectibles, etc
    - Crypto Art projects:
        - Zora
            - Trying to solve [[The Yeezy Problem]]
                - When Kanye drops a limited edition pair of sneakers for $250, in theory everyone is able to get them for that price
                - However, scrapers and bots are able to buy up a whole bunch and then resells them on the secondary market for a lot more
                - While this drives the price up, creators don't realize the benefit of that increase an price and true supports of the creator end up having to pay a lot more. The middleman (the bots and scrapers) are the ones who benefit
            - **Zora solves this with a currency that's redeemable on their marketplace for a physical product**
            - Product prices can fluctuate with supply and demand
            - People can speculate on the price
            - The creator benefits from each sale
            - Each token represents one physical pair of sneakers. With Zora you can then sell the token (and sneakers) back to the market for a profit (or a loss)
        - Foundation
            - Creator can sell design, art, and fashion
            - Users can buy the token and redeem them for physical items whenever you want
    - The Future
        - Creators as a crypto primitive (Brian Flynn)
        - Zora and Foundation are the first types of applications that bring creators into crypto. But they're really just the first stage
        - There will be a second stage that will bring even more
        - Creators to earn and users to speculate
        - APIs
            - TheGraph - getting data
            - Torus - signing in in a way that users are familiar with
            - Wyre - trading/exchanging with cheaper fees
        - Developers will build around creators (and their audience) rather than the other way around (as they do in Web2)

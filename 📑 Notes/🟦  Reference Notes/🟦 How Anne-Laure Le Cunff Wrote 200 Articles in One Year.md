    - Ask Anne-Laure Le Cunff how she built her productivity stack and you get an answer that sounds more like a Zen koan than a list of apps and life hacks. “My system works for me because it works for me,” she calmly explains. 
    - She writes 3 articles a week for her newsletter, and has amassed an audience of over 14,000 subscribers since she started. She’ll publish over 200 pieces this year. And as if all that wasn’t enough, she’s simultaneously earning a masters degree in applied neuroscience at King’s College in London. 
    - It turns out that the core weapons in Anne-Laure’s mindful arsenal are remarkably analog. She uses a “plus, minus next” format to help her review her week, and combines that with a dead-simple planning technique: every Sunday night, she writes out a single Post-It note with three goals to accomplish for the week. 
    - For her, mindful productivity means consistently taking a step back to examine what she’s doing and why she’s doing it. It helps her make sure that each item on her todo list actually has value before she plows through it. 
    - Anne-Laure introduces herself and explains mindful productivity 
    - I am the founder of Ness Labs, which is a platform where I offer content, community, and coaching to help people apply mindful productivity principles to their work and lives.

Ness Labs is a response to the vast majority of productivity writing out there, which is all about getting stuff done, without encouraging people to ask themselves why they want to get those things done 
    - We want to change your thinking about productivity from quantitative to qualitative. What I mean by that is your week shouldn’t be about getting a lot done, but about doing the things that really matter. That’s how you know whether or not you’re succeeding. 
    - Avoiding burnout isn’t the ultimate goal of mindful productivity, but I think it’s a benefit of applying these principles to your life and work. If you have a mindful, balanced approach to the way you live your life, you will also, as a consequence, end up doing your best work. 
    - Her week starts with a Sunday night review 
    - Whatever productivity apps or system you want to use, I’ve found that the habits that work best are the ones you don't need to force yourself to keep. 
    - She uses “plus, minus, next” to review her week 
    - My weekly review is in my notebook—it's analog. I turn my notebook horizontally, and I do three columns: What went well, what didn't, and what I want to work on the next week. This is called plus, minus, next. 
    - She uses Post-It Note todo list 
    - After I do “plus, minus, next,” I boil down my goals for the week on a Post-It that I put in front of me on the wall. I try to be mindful here, and keep the note to three things maximum every week. Three things. That’s it. These aren’t tasks to check off; they’re more like themes to keep me on track. 
    - She uses time blocking to plan her weeks 
    - I only have two repeating blocks on it — for writing throughout the week, and my Sunday weekly review. Both are very important to me. They're long term habits that I want to build. I think that if there's something that you want to do that is a long-term objective, it's really important to make sure that you make the time for it and that you don't just wait until you feel inspired. Block the time. 
    - While doing my weekly review, I also block time for the important things coming up. All of my tasks for the week live in my calendar. 
    - She uses a productivity inbox to help her generate ideas 
    - As far as what I write about, I never really struggle to find ideas.

I’m constantly adding content to my “creativity inbox.” If I’m on the go—like having conversations with people or reading on the bus—I capture notes on my phone. 
    - Another source of raw inspiration is my browser history; I use an extension that I really love called Enhanced History. 
    - The last thing I use for writing inspiration is Twitter; I bookmark everything that I find interesting there. 
    - Her newsletter writing process starts in Roam 
    - Once have an outline, I go to Google docs and write out the article. Having done all the prep and research work, I’m able to sit down and just write. 
    - I write at least three articles a week this way—more than 200 articles since I started about a year ago. Each article tends to be between 800 and 1200 words. That’s it. That’s how I write so much. It’s not a secret, just a series of habits that I’ve designed to make it easy for myself to keep. 
    - She carefully manages her information diet to make sure she achieves balance 
    - I read to find inspiration for my writing, but at one point I was also feeding my brain too much topical content. I didn’t have a balanced diet. It wasn’t very mindful and it certainly didn’t help my productivity. So I’m currently making a very conscious effort to rebalance myself. 
    - I strongly believe that consuming content should be similar to consuming food, especially when you work in an industry where your value is based on your intellectual output, and where your brain is your most important tool. The input you give to your mind is very important

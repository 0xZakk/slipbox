- **Summary:**
- **Highlights:**
    - Depending on the month and Google's mood, 10,000 to 20,000 people read this site per day.
    - The various products associated with the site earn over $10,000 a month, almost entirely passively. Last month they made over $60,000. 
    - **Why this Post, and How it's Structured **
        - There are plenty of articles on "how to start a blog." They mostly focus on what hosting company to use and how to find a theme. But those are the easy parts. ==**The hard part is making something other people care about that elevates your career and life. "Starting a Blog" is easy. "Starting a Blog that Changes Your Life" is hard. **==
        - As such, this is not about how to start a marketing blog that changes your life. Or how to start a blog for your business. ==**It's about starting one for yourself and about yourself, that you can leverage for anything you do in your life. **==
    - **Publishing Frequency and Building the Writing Habit **
        - [[ðŸŸ¨ The most important thing for your personal site's success]]
        - ==**The most important requirement for creating a blog that changes your life is continuing to publish on it.**==
        - You can occasionally change your life with one article, but it's rare. **A life changing blog is a long-term, compounding project that requires you to keep working on it. **
        - Over the last 6 years on this site, I've published 171 (now 172!) articles, 263 notes from books, and 215 Monday Medleys. That's 650 pieces of content, over ~2,100 days, or something every 3-4 days. That's kind of insane, I didn't even realize it was that much stuff until I did the math. 
        - The publishing frequency you should aim for is determined by which of two buckets you fall into. 
        - **Bucket 1: You Have the Writing Itch **
            - **Is writing something you already feel self-motivated about and have some itch to do?**
            - Ignore any compulsion to stick to a schedule. If you're doing a blog like this one, you'll be fine whether you publish once a month or once a day. 
            - **But having some requirements, even with the writing itch, can help.** I don't force myself to write an article every week since that'd be impossible with posts like this one. But I do force myself to publish a Medley every week since they require me to keep reading. 
        - **Bucket 2: You're New to Publishing Your Thoughts Online **
            - Is writing a habit you're not used to? Does it feel like a chore? Are you uncomfortable publishing your thoughts online? No worries, everyone starts here, and that feeling quickly goes away. **You can quit having a schedule eventually, but you first have to make yourself someone who feels compelled to write. Until you're in that camp, you need a schedule.** 
            - It doesn't matter if it's 1, 3, or 5 posts a week. Set one you think you can stick to and stick to it. 
            - Start by publishing often until you have more article ideas than you'll ever have time to write, and until you know you'll keep writing without a fixed schedule. 
    - **What to Write About **
        - ==**It's the posts you spend the longest thinking about that will land the biggest splash.**== Not necessarily the ones you spend the longest writing. But the longest thinking about and preparing for. 
        - **The longer you've spent thinking about a topic, the more you'll probably have to say, which is why most of your posts should tend towards being longer. **
        - If your interest in the subject only lasts 500 words, it's probably not a great post. Most of mine end up being at least 1,000 words, often 2,000+ 
        - **The other reason to focus on writing fewer, longer posts is it condenses your knowledge into a more helpful manner for anyone looking to learn from you. **
        - That's a combination of good SEO, and good curation. People don't want to read 10 articles or 30 guides. They want one great resource. Your job is to create a great resource for whatever you're writing about. 
    - **Should You Pick a Niche? **
        - **I don't recommend picking a niche for a personal site. **
        - The only common theme is they're all topics I'm interested in at the time of writing. The biggest challenge isn't writing consistently, it's finding topics so interesting that youâ€™ll write something great about them. 
    - **Finding Topics to Write About **
        - **To have an interesting blog, you must be interested in what you're writing about. ** [[ðŸŸ¨ How to find things to write about]]
        - Most of my posts, especially the good ones, fall into one of three buckets: 
            - **Things you know **
                - ==**To write a "things you know" post, take any topic youâ€™re interested in and share your knowledge on it.**== You don't need to be the top expert in the world. You need to have something useful to add to the conversation. Or, you need to show you know enough about an area to be taken seriously on it. 
                - **A good way to brainstorm topics in this category is to think about what questions you regularly get asked. **
                - If you get asked certain questions by people online, or by friends outside your industry, those are perfect topic to write about. It'll force you to distill your knowledge into something easily digestible by someone else, and it might be useful to tons of people who haven't thought to ask you about it. 
            - **Things you're excited about **
                - ==**Hype is contagious, so if you're excited about something, share it on your site. **==
            - **Things you believe **
                - The last main category I've seen tend to do well is things I believe. 
                - This category of articles can be intimidating because it requires taking a stance that will piss at least a few people off. If you write an "I believe" post and you don't piss some people off, you're not doing it right. But you'll find that as often as you get messages like "you idiot you're wrong" you'll get messages like "I'm so glad someone finally said that." 
                - A good heuristic for this kind of article is, if you're thinking "ehhh maybe I shouldn't write about that" then you should probably write about it. Most people are playing it safe with their content. Have an opinion and write something more interesting. 
        - **Above all else, be interesting **
            - [[ðŸŸ¨ The golden rule of writing online]]
            - ==**The only real rule is don't be boring.**== If you're repeating what other people have said, and not sparking new ideas or insights in your readers' minds, your articles are unlikely to do well.
    - **Promotion: How to Get Readers **
        - **I don't recommend fixating on marketing or SEO or "what your readers want to read." Again, if youâ€™re writing something for clicks and you're not interested in it, it's unlikely to turn into a good piece. ** [[ðŸŸ¨ Marketing your personal site]]
        - Your goal should be for who you are online to match who you are in real life. No gimmicks, no performing, no salesmanship. ==**Just be an interesting person. **==
        - But that doesn't mean you shouldn't do any marketing. ==**It means marketing for a personal site has to come after you decide what to write.**== 
        - The marketing and promotion and SEO and whatnot come after. First focus on finding good topics to write about. 
        - There are three kinds of promotion for a site like this (in increasing order of importance): [[ðŸŸ¨ Three kinds of traffic for your personal site]]
            - **Surge Traffic **
                - **Surge traffic is the thrilling spikes in traffic from many people discovering your site all at once. **
                - This traffic is fantastic for getting new people to discover your work, but it's temporary. Surges last a few days at best, then the virality ends and you're back where you started, with only a few more people following what you're doing. 
                - Long term, surge traffic is the least repeatable and least useful form of promotion to focus on. 
                - Surge traffic comes from one of a few places: 
                - **Social virality**: You wrote a post people love, so it gets picked up on social media and is shared like crazy. 
                - **Influencers**: Someone with a big audience found what you wrote and shared it. 
                - **Communities**: Your piece performed well in an online community with an active userbase, and they all checked it out. 
                - Most social virality comes from writing a great post at the right time. Most of Influencer surge traffic comes from... writing a great post at the right time and the right person finding it. 
                - But community surge traffic is a little different. That one you can engineer to an extent. 
                - In the beginning with this site, I used reddit extensively to try to get initial readers. 
                - So what's the secret to getting a big spike of traffic from reddit? Unfortunately it's a fairly dull strategy: write a great article, find a good community to share it in, post it, maybe cheat a little bit by having 3-4 extra reddit accounts upvote it, and cross your fingers. It won't work most of the time, but when it does, it can be a game changer. 
            - **Evergreen Traffic **
                - ==**Every article should have some evergreen value**== if you want to maximize the effectiveness of your time spent writing. 
                - So how do you get evergreen traffic? Well, the biggest way is through SEO. If you can write a post on a topic people are searching in Google, and have your post show up in the top few spots for that search query, you're going to keep getting traffic for a long long time.
            - **Audience Traffic **
                - ==**Audience traffic is the most valuable kind of traffic by far.**== It's people reading your content because it was written by you. 
                - ==**This is the ultimate goal for any blog. **==
                - ==**It's also a big part of how you monetize your site.**== The more audience traffic you have, the more you can make real money from your site beyond trying to get better ad CPMs. 
                - **So how do you build audience traffic? Well, you need a way for people to get updates on whatever you're doing. The best way to do that is through at least one social media channel you're active on, and an email newsletter. **
                - Your emails themselves should provide some value, kind of like what I do with the Medley. By providing value in the body of your emails, you're giving people reason to tell others about your newsletter, and helping it grow organically over time. 
    - **Patience ** [[ðŸŸ¨ The hardest part of building your personal site]]
        - **The hardest part with promoting your work though is the patience it requires. It will take a long time to build up any kind of meaningful audience, and in the beginning it wonâ€™t be rewarding. **
        - There are no shortcuts, because the only way to keep an audience is to keep being interesting. 
    - **Monetization and Spotting Opportunities **
        - ==**This site never made more than $100 in a month for the first couple years.**==
        - Monetization was not the goal. But if you work on something long enough and build an audience, ==**opportunities to monetize naturally follow. **==
        - ==**You should focus on building an audience and sustainable traffic before you focus on monetization.**== If no one is coming to your site, it doesn't matter if you tweak your CTAs or try new ads layouts. Get the audience, and the revenue will follow. 
        - I try to pretend the site income doesnâ€™t exist, funnel it straight to investments, and base financial decisions on my income from Growth Machine. 
        - But once you have the audience, how do you monetize? There are three main areas of focus:
        - **Affiliate Sales **
            - ==**Treat affiliate income for a personal site as bonus money. You don't want to focus on it because you'll hurt the genuineness of your content.**== But when there's an opportunity to include it, why not? 
        - **Ads **
            - Ads are the default impulse for anyone trying to monetize their site,==** but for a personal site they're not effective. **==
            - The other way this site makes money from "advertising" is through Medium. The Medium partner program pays you based on the number of claps your articles get from other paying readers. Most articles won't pay you more than a dollar or two, but if you get lucky with a viral hit then you could make quite a bit. 
            - The crazy part about the Medium partner program is there's no exclusivity agreement, so you can republish your articles there and hope one of them sticks. There's no cost to you except a few minutes of your time, and you could end up making a few grand.
        - **Products **
            - Since I started making products for this site, ==**they've brought in the majority and the most consistent revenue**==. And the best part is they require almost no ongoing work, making them fairly passive income for the site. 
            - The Roam Course exemplifies the product-focused strategy for blog monetization. Treat each article as a little MVP, and when one does well, find a way to better monetize that line of thinking. 
            - **Publishing an article is an extremely low cost way to test business and product ideas since you're making sure you have interest and an audience to market to before you build anything**, instead of spending months building something and then hoping people will be interested in buying it. 
    - **Getting Started **
        - The challenge with reading a post like this is the thought in the back of your head that doing all this seems toatally impossible.
        - 650 pieces of content is lots of work. 6 years is a long time. And whoâ€™s to say youâ€™ll get the same results?
        - That shouldnâ€™t deter you though. I donâ€™t know a single person with a personal site who regrets investing in it. But I know a number of people without personal sites who wish theyâ€™d started one sooner. 
        - I canâ€™t guarantee that following what worked for me will get you to the same place I am.
        - But I can guarantee it will get you somewhere you never expected.

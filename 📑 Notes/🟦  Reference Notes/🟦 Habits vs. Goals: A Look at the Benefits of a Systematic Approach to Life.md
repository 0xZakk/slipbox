## Summary:

In this article, Shane Parrish argues that habits are a better approach than goal-setting when it comes to accomplishing things in life. While goals tend to get the most attention (and tend to be everyone's default action when trying to accomplish something new), habits are actually much better.

Because habits become automatic, you don't have to think about them. With time, it becomes easier for your brain to perform the habit than not.

- **Highlights:**
    - **Because SEO means free,Â __recurring__Â traffic!**
    - **So what is SEO exactly?**Â SEO is a way of making sure that search engines can understand what your page is about, that it contains quality up-to-date information from an authoritative source, and will answer the question that the searcher had in mind (reader intent!!!).
    - It's Day 3 of our blogging challenge, and I'm going to walk you throughÂ **my basic on-page SEO process**Â so you can see how easy it can be to make your blog search-friendly, from keyword research to content.
    - It includes these steps:
        - Discover keywords
        - Niche down to a main keyword you can rank for
        - Find related tail keywords
        - Write the post and include those keywords in strategic places
        - Craft anÂ __excellentÂ __title people will want to click on
    - **EXAMPLE**: In today's email, I'll walk you through my process of how to write a post that'sÂ __generally__Â aboutÂ **"how to use react router"**.
    - **Step 1. Discover keywords**
        - First thing I'll do is think about keywords. I'll open up Google and search for "react router".
        - [Keywords Everwhere](https://keywordseverywhere.com/) browser extension
        - Next I'll double-check the data in my favorite keyword research tool for beginners,Â **KeySearch.**

    - **Step 2. Niche down to a keyword you can rank for**
        - Now, first thing you might notice is that the top 3 results for "React Router" are, well, the official website for the project. Chances are I can't (and shouldn't) outrank them for a term like "react router".
        - But what other topics are currentlyÂ **__underserved__Â **about React Router, which I could write about, and rank for?
        - What I can see is that it's extremely hard to rank for. But what I want to do is find some terms that are not THAT hard.Â **And I can see two here: "react router link" and "react router typescript".**
        - Now, 37 is not a "low score" (you can get as low as 10-20, those results will be a bright blue). But it's more attainable, and if you create multiple bits of content around React Router, you have a better chance of ranking for all of them!
        - If I search for "react router typescript", I can see that the content is not that great and the search results page isn't over-saturated with videos, and some of the page 1 results are from Stackoverflow instead of tutorials.Â **I believe I can do it better :)**
        - So now I've decided, I want to try for theÂ __main__Â keyword "**react router typescript**".
    - **Step 3. Find tail keywords**
        - Tail keywords are basically likeÂ **related keywords**Â that can help you make a more COMPLETE blog post. So if I see people search for "react router params" and "react router link", i should definitely include those in my post with e.g. sub-sections titled "How to use React Router Params with TypeScript".
        - It's also a chance to "double dip", just in case I might rank for a more competitive search term.
        - Just make a list of those related keywords as bullet points in your post for future reference. Aim for 10-20 tail keywords at a minimum, they don't all need to be sections or perfectly related to your topic.
    - **Step 4. Write the post and include those keywords in strategic places**
        - You shouldÂ __naturally__Â use those keywords in some places, such as:
            - Your meta title and description
            - Your subheadlines
            - Your first sentence or sentences
            - As the anchor texts on internal links from your other related posts to the post you're writing
            - Your image file names and alt tags (just remember the alt tag's primary use is for accessibility reasons)
            - Throughout your paragraphs
        - **However, there are other important tactics for ranking besides pure quality,Â **especially for competitive search terms
        - Luckily, as I will mention later,Â **most developers don't optimize their content for SEO**Â whatsoever, the competition is lower than you might expect.
    - **Step 4b. External links**
        - You should also link to websites with more resources on related topics, but not necessarily to content that is competing with you for the top spot.
        - For example, React Training doesn't have any content about "react router typescript". So I can "safely" link to them, as a major authority about React Router, withoutÂ __competing__Â with them.Â **This tells Google I'm a complete resource on the topic and doesn't hurt my chance at ranking.Â **(That's because, as I just mentioned, Google uses links as a way to determine a website's authoritativeness on a topic)
    - **Step 5. Craft an excellent title people will want to click on**
        - It doesn't need to be__Â clickbait__Â to be a compelling headline. It should be descriptive, succinct, and accurate. Here are just a few ideas for our example:
            - **React Router with TypeScript: The Complete Guide**Â - Completion is important!
            - **How to use React Router with TypeScriptÂ **- Simple and straightforward
            - **Step-by-step: How to use React Router with TypeScriptÂ **- Promises to approach the topic in small steps
            - **Use React Router with TypeScript (2020 Guide)**Â - Tells you the material is up-to-date
        - The reason the title is so important is a) Google uses your click through rate as a ranking factor b) If no one clicks on your post by reading the title, your effort is kind of wasted. Always write multiple headlines before deciding one!

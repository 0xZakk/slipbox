    - But tossing your crypto into an account where it can earn 5 to 10% annually is just the beginning. Using more advanced Decentralized Finance protocols like I‚Äôm going to cover here, you can get those numbers up to 15 to 20% by letting software optimize how your savings are allocated.
    - You have some cryptocurrency you‚Äôd like to earn interest on, so you check out lending protocols like Compound and AAVE for the best rates.

But unlike a traditional bank, the interest rates for different cryptocurrencies on different protocols are changing constantly, depending on how much people want to borrow the type of crypto you‚Äôre loaning. Today, you might get 8% APR (yearly interest rate) for your USDC on Compound, but tomorrow that might drop to 3% and AAVE might have the better rate.
    - In the physical world, there‚Äôs no great way to move your savings around daily to get the highest interest rate. And you‚Äôd be somewhat insane to try to do it. But in the crypto world, it is possible. Since transactions are fast and permissionless; you could wake up every day and reallocate your funds into the platform with the highest rewards.
    - Lucky for you, you don‚Äôt have to. Programmers in the Decentralized Finance space have built software that can do it for you.
    - The big project in this space is called Yearn. It was started by Andre Cronje who was trying to do exactly what I described earlier: he was rotating his savings between different platforms daily and wanted to write code to do it for him.
    - How Yearn Works
    - The simplest way to understand Yearn is that it algorithmically provides you exposure to many of the best ways to earn interest on your cryptocurrency online. Similar to how a hedge fund manager might take your capital and allocate it to where they see the highest return, Yearn can take your funds‚Äîwhether they‚Äôre USDC, Ether, Bitcoin, or any of a number of other assets‚Äîand allocate them to wherever those funds are going to earn you the highest return on investment.
    - That return comes from a process called ‚Äúyield farming.‚Äù Yearn hunts around between the different borrowing and lending platforms to find where you‚Äôll get the highest return on your capital, reallocates funds as necessary, and can automatically compound your returns faster than you could on your own.
    - The transaction costs or ‚Äúgas fees‚Äù of constantly moving your money around make it cost-prohibitive to do this yourself, but since Yearn is allocating billions of dollars, those gas fees are negligible. That‚Äôs because the gas fees are the same whether you‚Äôre sending $1,000 or $1,000,000. They‚Äôre based on the network congestion, not on the amount you‚Äôre sending.
    - Each ‚ÄúYearn Vault‚Äù allows you to stake a different asset to earn interest on it. That could be a stable coin pegged to the US Dollar like USDC, DAI, and Tether, but you can also stake Ethereum, Bitcoin, and other more volatile assets.
    - For each Vault, Yearn employs a variety of investing strategies based on market conditions and can rotate between them as prices and interest rates fluctuate.
    - Using Yearn
    - First, go to Coinbase or Coinbase Pro and purchase a stable coin like DAI or USDC.
    - Once you have MetaMask installed, you can copy your wallet address and paste it into Coinbase for where to send your DAI to:
    - After the coin shows up in your MetaMask wallet, you can go to Yearn and deposit them straight into Yearn.
    - This will require two transactions: one to give Yearn approval to receive your funds, and one to actually deposit the funds.

    - Once that‚Äôs done, you don‚Äôt need to do anything else. You can check in on how it‚Äôs growing, and withdraw your funds, including any gains, any time you want. It‚Äôs worth mentioning too that your gains are automatically compounding. You don‚Äôt need to re-stake anything.

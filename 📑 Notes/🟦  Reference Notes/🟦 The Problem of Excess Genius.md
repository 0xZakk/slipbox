    - The most important question we can ask of historians is "Why are some
    - periods and places so astonishingly more productive than the rest?" It
    - is intellectually embarrassing that this is almost never posed
    - squarely -- I can think of only two articles (Gray, 1958 and 1961) and
    - two books (Kroeber, 1944 and McClelland, 1961) that tackle this
    - directly. But Gray is a lunatic, Kroeber waffles vaguely, and
    - McClelland veers off into a fascinating but incomplete assessment. The
    - question has never been the focus of professional attention in social
    - history, although its answer would have thrilling implications for
    - education, politics, science and art.
    - The Problem
    - Geniuses are not scattered uniformly through time and space. Some
    - cultures have many more than one would expect, even after making
    - sensible allowance for imperfect records, biased perspectives and such
    - gross factors as famine, war, and the magnetic effect of libraries and
    - patronage. Obvious clumps of geniuses occur in
    - Athens, from about 440 BCE to 380 BCE,
    - Florence, from about 1440 to 1490,
    - London, from about 1570 to 1640.
    - If the reader agrees that these three societies show such a remarkable
    - excess of creative accomplishment that explanation is demanded, skip
    - on to section 2. The remainder of this section is just a borderline
    - pretentious argument to convince rational skeptics that random chance
    - is an inadequate explanation for the intellectual inhomogeneity that
    - history records. First, the three cities and times listed above are
    - not unique -- there are many other accumulations, although these are
    - particularly conspicuous. One can spend pleasant postprandial hours
    - noting similar clusters in Weimar, Paris (twice), London (again),
    - Vienna, Japan (late Heian period), Persia (just before Genghis Khan),
    - the T'ang dynasty, and New York, at times that I hope most readers can
    - discern for themselves. My sense is that there is a continuum of
    - remarkability, from the three stellar cases listed first through the
    - slightly humbler collections indicated in this paragraph, and the
    - degree of remarkability shades imperceptibly into average societal
    - behavior. (There are also major vacuums in intellectual achievement --
    - the Dark Ages were notoriously weak, and one should recall Orson
    - Welles' comment that 500 years of Swiss peace produced only the cuckoo
    - clock.)
    - But let us focus on the first list. Were general citizens asked to
    - name famous Athenians, the handful of names produced would come
    - entirely from the indicated period. Even were an academic
    - interrogated, the list would surely lean (list?) towards this period
    - (Euripides, Sophocles, Aeschylus, Aristophanes, Plato, Socrates,
    - Thucydides, Herodotus, Xenophon, Anaxagoras, Demosthenes, Pericles,
    - Aspasia, Alcibiades, Praxiteles, Phidias, Protagoras, Aristippus,
    - Isocrates, Lysias, Lycurgos, Polygnotos, . . .). The suggested dates
    - are obviously approximate, but I defy anybody to name an Athenian who
    - amounted to anything that was born after 380 BCE (well, Kazantzakis
    - will get a footnote, and if anyone were foolish enough to put forward
    - Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, I remind them that the extant
    - writings are of Alexandrian origin).
    - So what happened to the cultural IQ of Athens over the last 23
    - centuries? The genetics didn't change appreciably (at least until
    - 1398, when Nicopolis fell to the Turks). Why did such vitality
    - stagnate?
    - Florence is almost as compelling. There is an early bump of
    - productivity with Dante and Boccaccio and Giotto and Cimabue, but it
    - faded out (perhaps as a subtle consequence of the the Black Plague).
    - Then came a new lot, with Michelangelo, Leonardo Da Vinci,
    - Machiavelli, Botticelli, Donatello, Politian, Mirandola, Lorenzo the
    - Magnificent, and so forth. But before the birth of Cimabue (1240) and
    - after the death of Galileo (1642), not much happened in the city. How
    - was it that all its achievements were concentrated into such a
    - relatively small proportion of its span? The question is particularly
    - puzzling when one realizes that today, in all of Italy, the standard
    - of education is higher, the promotion of merit is easier, and the
    - population is enormously greater; nonetheless, there is no one that
    - could seriously be compared to Dante or Leonardo or Michelangelo.
    - Elizabethan London is the third example. Marlowe and Shakespeare and
    - Jonson and Raleigh and Bacon and Spenser laid the foundation for
    - English writing, and there are a host of lesser luminaries whose hands
    - helped. But their momentum ended with the coming of Cromwell (Milton
    - stands alone). From the close perspective of college courses in the
    - Restoration and Neoclassical periods, we can name many well-regarded
    - writers (Dryden, Pope, Wycherly) before the Romantic poets burst
    - forth, but the central point is that English talent isn't evenly
    - sprinkled like pepper on potatoes; rather, it clots inhomogeneously.
    - If these litanies of names have not persuaded the skeptical reader
    - that geniuses are sometimes superabundant, then a more formal debate
    - is needed. To pursue that dialogue, I would ask such readers to decide
    - how they would plan to calculate the numbers of geniuses they'd expect
    - to see under their models, in order that we may compare their figures
    - to the historical record. But for me, that smacks of straining at
    - gnats when there are important camels to swallow.
    - There is much else one could say. It is interesting to compare the
    - primary modes in which these societies operated (Athens did plays and
    - philosophy, Florence did painting and sculpture, London did poetry and
    - plays), and speculate upon the modern roles of television, performance
    - art, and rap. Also, scientific progress seems slightly less likely to
    - concentrate than do the arts and letters, and this can be tediously
    - delineated at some future time.
    - Previous Answers
    - Having posed the problem, let's proceed to a catalogue of some of the
    - stock answers that have been given previously. The following four can
    - be rejected out of hand.
    - Hegel, in his The Philosophy of Right, proposed the Zeitgeist theory
    - of genius. But this, at best, is description masquerading as
    - explanation. As good empirics, we seek a more specific understanding
    - of the problem.
    - Kroeber (1944) listed many cases of apparent accumulation, and lists
    - all the obvious factors (economy, education, world leadership, etc.)
    - that might play a role. His perspective is anthropological and
    - psychological, and he weaves in a fashionable amount of Toynbee. But
    - he confesses that he is unsatisfied with his treatment, and I concur.
    - Gray (1958, 1961) believes that geniuses arrive according to
    - numinously perfect mathematical cycles. He identifies three distinct
    - periodicities, and shows that when all simultaneously peak, high
    - culture hits the jackpot; when all three trough, the world's culture
    - is comparable to an Alabama high school's. The man is insane. (Readers
    - who disagree with this casual dismissal of his lifework are invited to
    - respond, but I shan't waste essay space on empty scholarly courtesy.)
    - McClelland (1961) counted the numbers of achievement images (e.g.,
    - "the farmer wrests his livelihood from the soil" vs. "the farmer sows
    - and reaps his sustenance") that appear in samples of text from periods
    - of artistic creativity and periods of artistic decline. He finds
    - statistically significant differences, argues that these reflect
    - important psychological differences, and speculates that the engine of
    - cultural enrichment is emphasis upon individual success.
    - Asimov (1951) suggested that psychohistorical forces could cause the
    - cultural florescences, but, after all, this is only science fiction.
    - And he never specifies the mechanisms that drive the advanced
    - mathematics.
    - Except for McClelland, these treatments suffer from vagueness. We want
    - explanations that make sense, and which can be corroborated by
    - specific historical research.
    - What type of explanation is adequate? My sense is that high points in
    - cultural history require the confluence of many factors; some of these
    - are more important than others. When all or most of the factors
    - coincide, then one has a Periclean Athens, Laurencian Florence or
    - Elizabethan London. When only several factors combine, the cultural
    - eruption is more humble -- one gets Goethe's Weimar, or the Lake
    - Poets. Things trail off gradually; if virtually none of the factors
    - obtains, then we call it a Dark Age. From this perspective, the
    - sought-for answer is a list of factors that facilitate/militate the
    - occurrence of genius, with some understanding of their relative
    - importance. In a crudely statistical way (retrodiction rather than
    - prediction), one can test hypothetical factors by determining whether
    - their presence is associated with higher measurements on some suitable
    - index of a society's florescence.
    - In general, it is statistically (and epistemologically) impossible for
    - the historical record to suggest the factors (this entails technical
    - statistical details; epexegesis is deferred). The researcher must make
    - clever guesses, which are then corroborated by the record. The next
    - section describes factors that have been proposed, and various
    - strategies for discovering plausible factors.
    - Searching for Factors
    - When I beard social historians at cocktail parties, they usually
    - dismiss the problem of explaining excess genius as complex and
    - ill-posed. But when coaxed into conversation, several ideas for
    - facilitating factors come forward:
    - Prosperity. They submit that a florescent culture needs the economic
    - wherewithal to support the arts.
    - Peace. They suggest that a climate of peace is also conducive to
    - philosophical, artistic and (perhaps) scientific progress. (But recall
    - Welles' comment on Switzerland.)
    - Freedom. They believe that artistic freedom from state or religious
    - control enables new growth.
    - Social Mobility. They think that when class distinctions are
    - relatively permeable, then there is greater inducement for artists to
    - excel.
    - The Paradigm Thing. They suppose that when a new medium or perspective
    - arises, then art flourishes until the vein of originality is worked
    - out.
    - All of these are good ideas, and superficially plausible. But most
    - contradict the historical record.
    - To be specific, the prosperity suggestion fails for Athens, Florence
    - and London. Athens spent its boom period in combat with Sparta; the
    - income from the Delian League went to the fleet. Athenian farmers
    - could not tend their crops (cf. The Acharnians), and such staples as
    - grain had to be imported. Similarly, quatrocento Florence was poor
    - compared to pre-plague Florence. The Medici bank had about half the
    - capital of the Peruzzi bank in 1340, and Lopez (1970) documents other
    - indications of reduced standards of living. A symptom of this
    - desperation was the revolt of the populo minuto, which pushed the
    - Medici into prominence. And Elizabethan London suffered "dearness
    - without scarcity" (inflation); this fell most heavily on the
    - aristocracy and the very poor. Then the wool trade collapsed, England
    - entered "the worst economic depression in history" (Wilson, 1965), and
    - Parliament anxiously debated means of averting a Bellum Rusticum.
    - Regarding the peace hypothesis, it clearly fails for Athens. Florence
    - was torn by internal factions (e.g., il popolo grosso vs. il popolo
    - minuto, the assassination of Giuliano de Medici, Savonarola). London
    - had to contend with the Armada, the war with Spain in Holland, and
    - internal religious dissent.
    - Regarding artistic freedom, the Athenian plays were written for
    - religious festivals, and the prize was awarded according to the taste
    - of respectable, pious and civic-minded judges (this caused
    - Aristophanes and Euripides no end of trouble). In Florence, art was
    - commissioned largely by the Church, sometimes by a patron, and had to
    - voice themes prescribed in the contract. In London, note that
    - Shakespeare's plays avoid all mention of religion and contemporary
    - politics; Marlowe and Jonson were similarly cautious (in literature,
    - not in their personal lives).
    - Regarding social mobility, this hypothesis seems borne out by our
    - three primary examples. Athens and Florence were both devaluing the
    - aristocracy and promoting mercantilism. In London, the early part of
    - the period clearly shows the rise of the middle class.
    - Regarding the emergence of a new paradigm, this is difficult to judge
    - concisely. Much of the problem involves distinguishing a perturbation
    - from an innovation. Did the introduction of a second on-stage
    - character in Athenian plays represent a new paradigm? Was Plato's
    - decision to record philosophical discussion a minor influence on the
    - content of the debate? Similarly, in Florence, painting and sculpture
    - were well-established before the peak occurred, but the invention of
    - perspective and the rediscovery of the classical period may have
    - constituted a paradigm shift. Finally, in London, the key change seems
    - to have been that small groups of strolling players discovered they
    - could pack a hall in a city, and people would stroll to them. This
    - enabled more elaborate props and larger companies, while pressing the
    - need for a larger repertoire. But this kind of change is not
    - especially Kuhnian in spirit, and the problem merits more lengthy
    - consideration.
    - One could propose other factors. It seems to me that each of the three
    - societies under consideration enjoyed a substantial military victory
    - in the generation preceding their florescence. Athenians whose names
    - shine today are reported to have prided themselves on being the sons
    - of the men who fought at Marathon. Florence was not a military force
    - (the Italian city-states relied upon mercenary condottieri in time of
    - war) but in 1254 they conquered Pisa and Lucca. This secured an outlet
    - to the sea, which was essential to their economic expansion. And in
    - 1588, England conquered the Spanish Armada. This made the seas safe
    - for colonial empire, and was a watershed for British morale.
    - Also, the great minds in each of these societies tended to hang out
    - together. Socrates spoke with everyone. The playwrights talked shop,
    - and the orators honed themselves upon each other. In Florence, artists
    - trained under an apprentice system that pulled talents together, and
    - Vasari describes frequent visits by the greats to each other's
    - studios. Leonardo and Michelangelo held a public contest over The
    - Battle of Anghiari; meanwhile, the poets and philosophers clubbed
    - together at Lorenzo's mansion. In London, much of the theater circle
    - met for drinks at the Mermaid Tavern, and one expects that their
    - common profession ensured their lives crossed even more regularly.
    - Aubrey reports that Bacon visited the Mermaid Tavern too, and
    - doubtless Bacon knew Raleigh, who was sufficiently friendly with
    - Marlowe to rise to the Shepherd/Nymph bait. Does the social
    - intercourse of good minds produce great minds?
    - A third possible factor is education. In each of the three societies,
    - education tended to be as personal as a punch in the nose. In Athens,
    - the upper class had tutors and the lower classes shopped for their
    - educations among various freelance teachers. In Florence, the upper
    - class had tutors and the masses learned as apprentices. In England,
    - the upper class had tutors and the commoners learnt to write plays and
    - poetry from each other, insofar as I can tell. All three of these
    - systems emphasize individual instruction over the currently popular
    - cattle drive approach. And there is ancillary evidence (cf. the lives
    - of Wiener, Maxwell, Dirac, Russell, Mill, Malthus, Arnold, Feynman)
    - that tutoring is enormously effective.
    - One can postulate many other factors. For example, it is suggestive
    - that all three of Athens, Florence, and London had populations near
    - 300,000. Also, all three had relatively democratic styles of
    - government, and all three's florescences were ended by right-wing
    - revolutions (the Rule of the 400, Savonarola, and Cromwell). Finally,
    - each of the three were in the process of reinventing their language --
    - Periclean Athens defined the conventions of Attic Greek, Dante made
    - Tuscan the foundation of modern Italian, and the linguistic gap from
    - Chaucer to Shakespeare is enormously larger than the gap from
    - Shakespeare to us (but this could be due to selection bias, since
    - language might gel around great writings, rather than great writings
    - arise from volatile language).
    - There is never any shortage of hypotheses. The useful trick is to know
    - how to test them. In this case, one could rank a sample of cities in
    - terms of their cultural IQ, and then decide whether the hypothesized
    - factor obtains for each of the cities. If the factor is more common
    - for the florescent cities than for the average or below average
    - cities, then the hypothesis is supported (this can be made formally
    - statistical). To an extent, this style of reasoning is what is used in
    - this section, except that I haven't elaborated the comparison by
    - listing cities which have made meager cultural contributions.
    - The Individual
    - There is an alternative strategy for studying the problem of excess
    - genius. Instead of focusing upon the society that produced them, one
    - can study the minutiÅ¾ of geniuses' lives, looking for commonalities
    - that might suggest cultural forces. For example, if a study of many
    - geniuses finds that disproportionate numbers were tutored, then one
    - might guess that creative societies were those in which tutoring was a
    - prevalent means of education.
    - Hayes and Simon (1985) report a study of composers. After sifting
    - through much biographical material, they conclude that a minimum of
    - ten years of serious study is required before anyone begins to produce
    - important music. And subsequent research suggests that this ten year
    - rule applies to many different disciplines, including mathematics,
    - chess and poetry (though possibly not philosophy). Allen Newell is
    - alleged to have proffered an explanation of this regularity:
    - Greatness is relative, and humans compete against other humans. If
    - intelligence is not a major factor, and if ten years represents the
    - amount of time an exceptionally dedicated human is willing to invest,
    - then, ceteris paribus, world class geniuses will be those who've
    - marinated in a subject for ten years.
    - Clearly, the controversial element in this line of research is its
    - underemphasis of the importance of native intelligence and skill.
    - In a similar mood, I undertook a study of 100 eminent men and women of
    - Victorian science and letters. With the help of 11 undergraduates, I
    - compiled a database that recorded 56 traits for each of the people
    - chosen. We then applied a laundry list of semi-sophisticated
    - statistical procedures to look for hidden patterns in the data. One
    - particular question of interest was whether there were biographical
    - traits that discriminated the artists from the scientists.
    - To give a better flavor of the project, the first twenty people in the
    - database are: Arthur Conan Doyle, Andrew Lang, Matthew Arnold, Jane
    - Austen, Charles Babbage, James Barrie, Jeremy Bentham, Sir Richard
    - Francis Burton, Charlotte Bronte, Thomas Carlyle, Arthur Cayley,
    - Charles Lamb, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Charles Darwin, Thomas
    - DeQuincey, Benjamin Disraeli, Charles Dodgson, Elizabeth Barrett
    - Browning, Robert Browning, and Michael Faraday. (The list is only
    - partially alphabetical, for technical reasons related to the software
    - and our occasional use of initials to distinguish some subjects.)
    - Similarly, some of the biographical traits that were examined included
    - birth order, family status, number of spouses, number of siblings, age
    - at father's death, age at mother's death, whether or not the subject
    - loved the father, ditto the mother, whether the subject was thrifty,
    - whether the subject was gay, an estimate of the subject's sexual
    - appetite, an estimate of the subject's precocity, a description of the
    - kind of schooling the subject received, the intensity of the subject's
    - religiosity, whether the subject had a sense of humor, whether the
    - subject drank, the age at which the subject first produced good work,
    - and so forth.
    - Unfortunately, the results of the analyses so far have been
    - unilluminating. It appears that Romantic poets tended to have been
    - raised by their mothers, and that scientists tended to come from
    - happy, stable families. However, the statistical support for both of
    - these conclusions is small (a=0.05), and the reliance upon
    - undergraduates for the gathering of information ensures that, despite
    - substantial efforts at data cleaning, the accuracy of the records is
    - not beyond question.
    - Conclusions
    - The problem of excess genius is one of the most important questions I
    - can imagine, but very little progress has been made. It surprises me
    - that essentially no scholarly effort has been directed towards it. I
    - warmly solicit any suggestions from readers that may help me to
    - clarify my own confusion and uncertainty regarding this.

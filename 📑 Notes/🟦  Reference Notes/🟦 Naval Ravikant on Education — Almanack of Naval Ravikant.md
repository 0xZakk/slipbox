    - Free education is abundant, all over the Internet.
It's the desire to learn that's scarce. 
    - The overeducated are worse off than the undereducated, having traded common sense for the illusion of knowledge. 
    - What is the purpose of our current education system? 
    - I think there‚Äôs no question, it‚Äôs completely obsolete. The education system is a path-dependent outcome from the need for daycare. From the need for prisons for college-aged males who would otherwise overrun society and cause a lot of havoc. 
    - College and schools and the way we think about them come from a time when books were rare. Knowledge was rare. Babysitting was rare. Crime was common. Violence was prevalent. I think schools are just byproducts of these kinds of institutions.

What schools matter for is wanting to keep the kids out of the parents‚Äô hair while the parents go to work. 
    - What has changed since then that has rendered our current education system obsolete? 
    - Now we have the Internet, which is the greatest weapon of knowledge ever created, completely interconnected. It‚Äôs very easy to learn. 
    - The ability to learn, the means of learning, the tools of learning, are abundant and infinite. It‚Äôs the desire that‚Äôs incredibly scarce. 
    - I think if it‚Äôs purely learning you‚Äôre after, learning can be done much more either on your own or through the Internet or by uniting through the Internet with like-minded groups. 
    - What value does our current education system provide, if any? 
    - The only benefit of school today is socialization. It creates socialization because kids want to be around their peers and they want to learn how to operate in the society of their peers. 
    - What needs to change about how we learn? 
    - In an age of Google and smartphones, memorization is obsolete. Why should you be memorizing the Battle of Trafalgar? Why should you be memorizing what the capital of that state is? We still put undue weight on that, because that‚Äôs how it was when we lived in a pre-Google world. 
    - The second problem is the current educational system has a one-size fits all model. It has to say you have to learn X now, then you have to learn Y. 
    - The moment you miss a rung in the ladder of mathematics, you can‚Äôt go to the next one. 
    - Now you get to calculus, and you don‚Äôt understand the fundamentals. Now, you‚Äôre reduced to memorization. You‚Äôre like, ‚ÄúDX/DY. When I see the symbol, I do this.‚Äù You‚Äôve lost the actual learning. You‚Äôve lost the connection to the underlying principles.

We teach all these kids calculus and they walk out not understanding calculus at all. 
    - What needs to change about what we learn? 
    - I think learning should be about learning the basics in all the fields and learning them really well over and over. Life is mostly about applying the basics and only doing the advanced work in the things you truly love, and where you understand the basics inside out. 
    - What would you focus on, if you were running a grade school curriculum? 
    - I would probably optimize for happiness, nutrition, and exercise.

Show them answers to ‚ÄúHow do you build good habits?‚Äù ‚ÄúHow do you break bad habits?‚Äù ‚ÄúHow do you have good relationships?‚Äù ‚ÄúHow do you build basic skills?‚Äù 
    - I would probably have them run a lemonade stand or a small business and earn money so they can understand how that works. Have them work on something charitable-related, or take them to the third world and show them suffering, true suffering, so they can get some context. I‚Äôd probably teach them public speaking, business writing, basic persuasion. Maybe a little bit of programming on top of the reading, writing, and arithmetic. 
    - I think the problem is we‚Äôre over-educated in weird ways and we‚Äôre mis-educated. 
    - Lots of literacy in modern society, but not enough numeracy. 
    - Coding is the new literacy. 
    - How can we create more effective schools? 
    - ‚ÄúSchools replace curiosity with compliance.‚Äù This was a tweet, @Kpaxs posted and I retweeted it. Five words. I love that because it is so short, just five words. I think that is so right. 
    - With children, you just have to feed their curiosity. 
    - You cannot force a child to be a self learner, all you can do is feed their curiosity. 
    - Why is curiosity so important? 
    - The work environment spends a lot of time beating your love of learning out of you. 
    - Perhaps the myth that adults can't learn new skills is tied to the myth that education requires formal schooling. 
    - We have this legacy idea: the only way to be properly educated is university. 
    - Credentialing, at least in the programming environment, you can get on your own to some extent. 
    - So if you are going to go to university, the first rule is: learn things that you can't learn by yourself. Because most things you can learn by yourself at home. 
    - What should people learn in college today, that they can‚Äôt learn on their own?

For most people, that means mathematics, programming, physics -- it's the STEM disciplines. It means having access to the tools, people, rigor, discipline, and exercises to learn them well. 
    - Learn math, kids. Speaking the language of nature is the ultimate superpower. 
    - Where the "free college" movement fails is that different degrees have different ROI. Putting someone on the wrong path costs them decades. 
    - We study science to learn how to get what we want. We study philosophy to know what to want in the first place. 
    - You know, the aristocracy of the United States are the people who went to good schools versus people who didn‚Äôt. They just had very different outcomes in life from that moment on. 
    - A generation of auto-didacts, educated by the Internet & leveraged by technology, will eventually starve the industrial-education system. 
    - If the primary purpose of school was education, the Internet should obsolete it. But school is mainly about credentialing. 
    - Even today, what to study and how to study it are more important than where to study it and for how long. 
    - The best teachers are on the Internet. The best books are on the Internet. The best peers are on the Internet. 
    - Universities artificially limit the number of graduates, keep tuition prices high, and provide just enough financial aid to qualify as non-profits. This enables the real business model - returns on massive endowments, compounding tax-free, and earning far more than tuition. 
    - The Internet will obsolete the industrial education system, just like it's obsoleting every other physical purveyor of information goods. 
    - It's so much easier to imagine job destruction than job creation, that even many tech investors and workers end up quasi-socialist. 
    - Believing that technology will create permanent unemployment is the same as believing that people can't be educated to build technology. 
    - Technology obsoletes jobs, but there is no upper bound on number of technology jobs themselves. Temporal displacement, not permanent. 
    - What is the single most important skill for people to gain today in order to maximize their practical knowledge? 
    - The people who are not technically literate are being left behind. I think one of the greatest charitable things we can do today is figure out how to retrain people to get comfortable with technology. The computer is the most powerful tool for creativity, the most powerful force-multiplier invented since the stone axe. And you don't need another human‚Äôs permission to use it. 
    - Someday, not being proficient with computers will be considered a form of illiteracy. 
    - I have to believe that we can change the system, but you never change a system by taking the existing thing and reworking it. I‚Äôve been in Silicon Valley and tech business long enough to know that you‚Äôre better off changing it just by creating something brand new. 
    - Imagine an online school where top scientists lecture a million kids at zero marginal cost. Add rigorous testing, diplomas. Goodbye college. 
    - To everyone saying that college is about connections and soft stuff - sure, but there are ways to do that without $200K and 4 years. 
    - The ideal school would teach health, wealth, and happiness. 
    - More brilliant autodidacts are in existence today, thanks to the Internet, than at any other time in human history.

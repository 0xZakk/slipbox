    - The hacks are the last straw. We need to exit Twitter.
    - Here's one recipe for gradual exit.
    - Step one is to set up an (optionally pseudonymous) newsletter at your own custom domain
    - Then only tweet out posts from your site, using your domain name as a simple form of authentication.
    - Step two is to start building your membership list at your own site.
    - And step three is to get off Twitter all together, and start building a decentralized media ecosystem that combines the sovereignty of individual domain names with the community of social networking.
    - The v1 of that is a simple joint RSS feed that aggregates multiple independent newsletters, but we can get much more sophisticated with tech for the decentralized web. It may turn out that what we build helps reform Twitter itself, but at a minimum it will present an alternative.
    - Before we get there though, let's go through the problems with Twitter.
    - The Problems with Twitter
    - It's not just the hack. There are several overlapping issues with Twitter around security, authentication, pseudonymity, distribution, incentives, and culture.
    - Twitter is insecure. It was a mistake to think that personal security could compensate for the fundamental flaw of centralized web services: anyone who gains control over twitter.com gains control over your account. We knew this already from the 2017 incident and the Jack Hack. But now the most prominent people and companies in the world (Bezos, Gates, Zuckerberg, Musk, Apple, Uber, among others) have been openly and publicly hacked. Tomorrow you may be the victim. And unlike these worthies, you may be silently and privately hacked. Perhaps you already have been.
    - Twitter is not authenticated. It was a mistake to trust Twitter's centralized verification process to validate everything posted to the service. There weren't any digital signatures to help establish whether the messages were really coming from a user-controlled device, or faked by a central server.
    - Twitter is not fully pseudonymous. It was a mistake to use our real names everywhere online, particularly on Twitter. It made us vulnerable to personal and physical attacks. Social media mobs can swarm your real name online and cancel you in real life. Doxxing can heighten the danger by making threats materialize in meatspace. Pseudonymity is a better default, especially now that we can earn under a pseudonym.
    - Twitter is a distribution chokepoint. It was a mistake to outsource our distribution to Twitter. Twitter users don't fully control their reach, brand, or monetization. You can be downranked or deplatformed at any time, just like you can on YouTube and other centralized platforms. Owning your own email list is a far better alternative.
    - Twitter doesn't create wealth. It was a mistake to have so many people spending so much time on something that arguably destroys more wealth than it creates. Because by default, you don't create wealth on Twitter. You may create wealth for Twitter, or for the media corporations whose links are circulated, but not for yourself or for others. There's no sense of economic alignment with other users, no sense of mutual obligation.
    - Twitter turns society into Twitter. It was a mistake to let Twitter set up the incentives for our society. It's not good for the world when the one thing every prominent person knows how to do is fight each other on Twitter for likes and followers. It has converted society into a zero-sum status game played by elites with real consequences. Every day, blue checks compete for a finite pie of attention with ever more sensational posts. There is instant feedback on what is popular, but none on what is true. The lack of economics, the presence of real names, the toxic culture, and the UX itself all encourage constant fighting.
    - Decentralization Starts with a Domain

    - Can we network together websites into decentralized media with something deeper than links?
    - I may be wrong about this, but I don't think a "better Twitter" starts with a service which is simply a clone of Twitter except with a different community. I think it starts with a community of independent (and independently monetizable) domains that we network together in novel ways, to build decentralized media.
    - Towards this end, the first step in gradually exiting Twitter is to set up your own paid newsletter at a custom domain (instructions here) and restrict yourself mainly to tweeting out posts. This does require more effort than writing 280 characters! But that's why it's good. Effort helps restore your attention span and improves average post quality.
    - The long-term step is to start addressing the issues with Twitter by knitting these individual domains together into an open source decentralized media ecosystem.
    - That means addressing:

Security by encouraging people to post from their own domains
Community by building a network around multiple domains
Authentication by combining domains with digital signatures
Distribution via memberships and email lists
Incentives by baking in monetization and economic alignment from the beginning
Mobs by recommending pseudonymity by default
Culture by encouraging physical norms of civility

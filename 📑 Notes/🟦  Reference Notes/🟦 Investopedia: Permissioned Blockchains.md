- **Summary:** 
- **Highlights:**
    - Permissioned blockchains can be seen as ==**an additional blockchain security system**==, as they **maintain an access control layer to allow certain actions to be performed only by certain identifiable participants**.
    - Permissioned blockchains provide **an additional level of security over typical blockchain systems** like Bitcoin, as they require an access control layer.
    - These blockchains are **favored by individuals who require security, identity, and role definition** within the blockchain.
    - Permissioned blockchains are not as common as other public blockchains like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
    - **How a Permissioned Blockchain Works**
        - There are certain other blockchains that need special permissions to read, access, and write information on them.
        - The intrinsic configuration of such blockchains controls the participants' transactions and defines their roles in which each participant can access and contribute to the blockchain.
        - Permissioned blockchains are also different from private blockchains, which allow only known nodes to participate in the network. For example, a bank may be running a private blockchain operated through a designated number of nodes internal to the bank. In contrast, permissioned blockchains may allow anyone to join a network once their identity and role are defined.
    - **Examples of a Permissioned Blockchain**
        - Permissioned blockchains are also popular among industry-level enterprises and businesses, for which security, identity, and role definition are important. For instance, a manufacturer producing a product may use a permissioned blockchain that also takes care of supply chain management. However, the transactions that occur on such a blockchain may also involve logistics partners, financing banks, and other vendors involved in the supply and financing process.
        - Technically, properly conceived permissioned blockchain networks are those which have an access-control layer built into the blockchain nodes.

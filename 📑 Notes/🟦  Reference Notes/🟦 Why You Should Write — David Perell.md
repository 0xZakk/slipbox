    - Words are the atomic unit of the internet. 
    - Writing online is a guaranteed way to shrink the world. A well-written article can change your life because the internet rewards people who think well. 
    - As Derek Sivers once wrote: “the coolest people I meet are the ones who find me through something I’ve written.” 
    - Writing is like weightlifting for the brain. Testing the limits of your ideas is the fastest way to improve them and raise your intelligence.  
    - While most people throw stones, writers move mountains.

 
    - Writers engage with reality like it’s a full-contact sport. It’s a collision between your mind and the world. 
    - Writing initiates the ultimate positive feedback loop. Online writers are rewarded with instant feedback, and fast feedback loops are the best way to accelerate your learning. 
    - Better yet, writing regularly will inspire you to live an interesting life. As your writing improves, so will the opportunities available to you. 
    - "If you wish you would take something more seriously, do it publicly… Social pressure forces you to up your game.” 
    - The only thing standing between you and your writing goals is discipline.

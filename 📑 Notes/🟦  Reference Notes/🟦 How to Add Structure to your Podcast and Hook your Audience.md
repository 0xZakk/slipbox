- **Summary:** 
- **Notes:**
    - Structure is behind every piece of content that we consume - podcasting is no different
    - We can just hit record and get going, but that isn't setting us up for success
    - Structuring our content is the key to to hook your audience and keeping them engaged
    - The Structure:
        - Intro:
            - Simple, but important
            - There are typically no visuals (this is what you're up against)
            - You have to be intentional and quick about capturing their attention
            - What's in it for them?
                - On a show level - what is the show about?
                - On the episode level - what is this specific episode about?
            - The first 1-2 minutes of your podcast:

            - Example:

            - Episode --> Show --> Why
        - Parts 1-3
            - We remember things best in phases of three
            - Capture attention in Intro, recapture their attention in each phase
            - Phase A - Start topic
            - Phase B - Hook them
            - Phase C - Finish topic
            - Examples:
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fzkfslipbox%2FULMCQiRi-a.png?alt=media&token=b6914d4e-bfec-4e9b-988f-03c11ac38c6e)
            - You don't always need 3 phases
            - Keep the experience of the listener in mind
        - Outro:
            - Make them come back for more
                - Capture their subscription, make them come back for more
            - Pieces:
                - 1. Reflection - how was this for you?
                - 2. CTA - one thing you want them to do
                - 3. Tease - what will the next topic be about

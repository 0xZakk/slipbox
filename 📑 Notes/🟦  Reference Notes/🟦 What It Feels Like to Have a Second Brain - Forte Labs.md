    - How does it feel to have a Second Brain?

It feels like raw power. Like energy coursing into my mind and body from every source of information I have access to. Like the world is made of ideas, and I have a key to its underlying reality. It feels like I am the master of my reality, able to draw in and shape and then deploy ideas in endlessly creative ways. 
    - Having a Second Brain gives me a profound confidence in the ambitions I am pursuing. Nothing can stop me, because I am building, collecting, gathering, recruiting every idea and insight from the world‚Äôs greatest thinkers in one centralized place. 
    - The experience I have as I work with my Second Brain is that we have a relationship. It is almost as complex as a person, with its own wants, needs, goals, and history. 
    - I know that every investment in this organism will return 10-fold, 100-fold, 1,000-fold. And not in some far off hypothetical future, but in a matter of hours, days, or weeks. Such a sure investment makes the superficial pleasures of social media lose all their color in comparison. I am on my devices as much as anyone, consuming as much information as anyone else. But I am not doing what everyone else is doing with it. I am preserving the very best of everything I am exposed to, like a patient gardener squirreling away seeds and cuttings from every garden in the world, to plant in his own magnificent creation. 
    - My Second Brain makes me feel abundant. There are so many resources everywhere. Like a Cambrian explosion of ideas and theories and frameworks and essays and tweets and income. 
    - Working inside my Second Brain, paradoxically, I can see that ideas by themselves aren‚Äôt worth much. When you have so many choices for every decision you need to make, so many answers to any question you might ask, so many possibilities for every unknown, it becomes crystal clear that information is a commodity. What is truly scarce and precious is humans and their stories, their desires, their dreams, their consciousness.

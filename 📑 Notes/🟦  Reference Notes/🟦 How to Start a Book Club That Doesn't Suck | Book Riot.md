    - To help you make sure your book club is on point, here is a short guide about how to start a book club to help you make yours perfect. 
    - ### 1. Figure Out Who You‚Äôre Inviting To Your Book Club
        - The first thing you should do is figure out who will come to your book club. 
        - This will be the most important choice you make, because it will affect everything else about the book club, from where and when you can meet to which book you read. 
    - ### 2. Define The Purpose Of Your Book Club
        - Do you want to learn something new? Do you want to bond with coworkers? Maybe you want to catch up with friends, meet new people, or even a mix of these. 
    - ### 3. Decide If You‚Äôre Meeting Online Or In Person
        - If you want to learn something new or meet new people, consider starting a group on Facebook, Goodreads, or your preferred social media platform. Opening up the group to people in your community will bring in new faces. 
        - Next, how will you communicate if you don‚Äôt meet online? 
    - ### 4. Figure Out When Your Book Club Will Take Place 
        - Sometimes fitting a book club into friends‚Äô schedules can feel like musical chairs. It seems like every date works except for one person. The easiest way to get around this is to plan in advance and keep to a schedule. 
        - Choosing one day every month would work best. This gives everyone time to get the book and read it. 
    - ### 5. Create A Process To Nominate Books To Read 
        - If you‚Äôve been thinking about starting a book club, you probably already have a book in mind. (Or twenty.)

But here‚Äôs a caveat: There is nothing worse than a book club dictator: you know, the kind of person who doesn‚Äôt take suggestions, who rules their book club with an iron fist. Don‚Äôt be that person. 
        - What do you need to keep in mind for a book club pick? A few factors to consider when picking a book for your book club include:

Topic
Length
Reading level
Price
Publication date
Availability on different readers (eBooks and audio options) 
        - What if someone disagrees with the selection? 
        - When you‚Äôre learning how to start a book club, you‚Äôll find out fast that disagreements about books can get heated. 
        - But as a leader of your book club, you need to take things in stride. For those who disagree, offer another option. 
        - Two mini book clubs meeting at the same time might make people happy. 
    - ### 6. Give Your Book Club Discussions Some Structure
        - How can you give everyone in your book club a voice? Be considerate of the reading preferences of others, and give everyone a chance to put their book choice in the ring. 
        - 8. Think About How You Will Conduct Your Book Club 
        - Finally, once you‚Äôve figured out how to start a book club when it comes to the nitty gritty stuff (when and who and what you‚Äôre reading), it‚Äôs time to think about it on a bigger level. Why are you hosting it and how? 
        - Some book clubs are more social than academic. Make it clear to your guests which kind you‚Äôve planned. 
        - Other Considerations For How To Start A Book Club 
        - After reading this article, you‚Äôre probably thinking: what else could there possibly be? Well, think back to your guests.

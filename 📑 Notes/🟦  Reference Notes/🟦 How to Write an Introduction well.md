    - On this first page, I'll show you how to write a strong introduction. Once you've nailed your intro, you'll know you have something to say.

 
    - The best topic to write about is the one you can’t not write about.

 
    - You can trigger this state of mind with a two-part trick.

 
    - First, choose an objective for your article:

 
    - Now pair that objective with a motivation:

 
    - That’s all that's needed: Pair an objective with a motivation. Now you have something to talk about. 
    - Your real objective is to hook readers into reading more.

 
    - A hook is not a gimmick. It’s a fundamental psychological principle: A great intro — like an electrifying opening to a film — buys goodwill with your audience. 
    - A hook is any half-told story:

 
    - Hooks tease your best talking points. They urge readers to keep reading by triggering the storytelling machinery in their heads.

 
    - You create hooks by finding questions you want answers to:

Ask yourself, “If someone else wrote my intro, what are the most captivating questions they could pose to make me excited to read this?”
Write those questions down. Even if you lack the answers.
Rank your questions by how much they interest you.
The top questions become your hooks: Pose them in your intro and don't reveal their answers. 
    - Your questions don’t have to be mind-blowingly interesting. They just have to be good enough for your target audience to keep reading. 
    - When you identify a good hook, you also identify an interesting talking point: the answer to the question becomes an idea you'll explore in your article.

 
    - This means if you find a really interesting hook, you’re forced to write a really interesting article to fulfill it.

That’s the point.

 
    - When hooks are the first part of your article, you have a critical opportunity to ask others for feedback: “After reading my intro, do you want to keep reading?”

If they say no, you saved yourself from writing an article no one cares about.

 
    - Writers think the best time to ask for feedback is after their first draft. Nope, the most efficient time to ask is after writing your introduction.

 
    - Often, skepticism outweighs the strength of your hooks, and readers quit reading early. You can do something about this. You can proactively counter the five types of skepticism within your intro:

Superficial: This is the skepticism of readers not believing you’ll share things they don’t already know.
Solution: Tease your original insights in your introduction.‍
Irrelevant: Readers don’t believe you’ll cover key points they care about.
Solution: List the points you’ll cover.‍
Sloppy: Readers don’t want to sit through more bad writing.
Solution: Rewrite your intro to be clear, succinct, and intriguing.‍
Implausible: Readers don’t believe you’ll answer your hooks well.
Solution: Make your hooks realistic. Don’t over-sell.‍
Untrustworthy: Readers don’t believe you're qualified to write about your topic.
Solution: If you have relevant credentials, share them. If not, make your hooks so captivating that they can't help but continue reading. Make the rest of your post so insightful, logical, and well-researched that they don’t question you further. 
    - Let’s return to the topic of asking for feedback. It's the only way to validate that your hooks work.

 
    - It's important to ask for a specific type of feedback:

Ask several people to rate your intro from 1 to 10 on how interested they are in reading more. Also ask, “If you were writing about this topic, what questions would you most want answered?” If their questions captivate you, swap them in.
To avoid high scores from friends just wanting to be kind, tell them: “Don’t be afraid to give me a low score. The more that people tell me this isn’t good yet, the more I'm motivated to make it even better. You’ll be helping me focus.”
Keep asking for feedback and rewriting your intro until you reach an average of 8/10. An 8 validates you’ve identified a compelling perspective. It’s a sign that self-doubt is probably unjustified.

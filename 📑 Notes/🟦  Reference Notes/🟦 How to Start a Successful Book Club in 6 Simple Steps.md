    - First, find members. 
    - When you begin searching for your inaugural book club members, Gorga recommends that you look in the places in your life that feel most natural to you. 
    - If you're open to a more digital-friendly approach, Thomasch says you should always keep social media in mind. Put the word out about your new club with a tweet, Facebook status, or Instagram story. 
    - Set some group guidelines. 
    - In order to make sure your new group is all on the same page, take the time to discuss what you want to get out of regular club gatherings before your first official meeting. Will your time together be spent largely focusing on the novel at hand, or will camaraderie and refreshments ultimately be the most important? 
    - Pick your book.

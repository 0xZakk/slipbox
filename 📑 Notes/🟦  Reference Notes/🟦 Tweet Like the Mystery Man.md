    - Twitter is like poetry: Treat every tweet like a Japanese haiku. Nail the look and the rhythm. The images, the formatting, and the context you set at the beginning. Every word counts, just like a poem. [[ðŸŸ¨ Tweet like poetry]]
    - Tweet about one thing: Every tweet should be about just one idea, no matter how long it is. Start with a simple sentence. Then elaborate. When you keep the idea simple, your tweet can be long but people will still read it. [[ðŸŸ¨ Tweets should be atomic]] 
    - Respect your readers: Take your audience seriously. Write the kinds of tweets youâ€™d like to see. Pay attention to the tweets that annoy you and add them to the forbidden list. Be kind. Donâ€™t be spammy by using a dozen hashtags. Improve the experience for your readers, and they will follow you. [[ðŸŸ¨ Respect your readers]]
    - Beyond these tricks, there are many ways to write good tweets. Keep in mind these best practices are suggestions, not rules. Find your own style and run with it. Borrowing from others is a fine place to begin, but aim to create your own style as fast as possible. Your Twitter should be a reflection of you.

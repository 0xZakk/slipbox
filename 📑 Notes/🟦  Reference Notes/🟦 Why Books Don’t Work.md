    - And at least for non-fiction books, one implied assumption at the foundation: people absorb knowledge by reading sentences. 
    - All this suggests a peculiar conclusion: as a medium, books are surprisingly bad at conveying knowledge, and readers mostly don’t realize it. 
    - “The Persistence of Memory,” 
    - Books break the shackles of time 
    - A book is proof that humans are capable of working magic 
    - Books don’t work for the same reason that lectures don’t work: neither medium has any explicit theory of how people actually learn things, and as a result, both mediums accidentally (and mostly invisibly) evolved around a theory that’s plainly false.

 
    - cognitive models 
    - “transmissionism.” 
    - to understand something, you must actively engage with it 
    - “metacognition.” 
    - By contrast, textbooks do have explicit cognitive models: they support engagement with their concepts through things like exercises and discussion questions. Yet much of the metacognitive burden still remains with the reader. 
    - Instead, I propose: we don’t necessarily have to make books work. We can make new forms instead 
    - It’s not just that it’s possible to create a medium informed by certain ideas in cognitive science. Rather, it’s possible to weave a medium made out of those ideas, in which a reader’s thoughts and actions are inexorably—perhaps even invisibly—shaped by those ideas.

    - Remember when I said Twitter helped me find my first job?

I made the connection in a public tweet but worked through the details of the job opportunity with private direct messages.
    - Direct messages are the dark matter of Twitter. It’s where most of the connections on Twitter are made, even though they’re away from the public eye. 
    - Direct messages work for multiple reasons. First, people receive fewer DMs than emails. Second, when somebody receives a DM, they can click on your profile to see if you’re legit. 
    - Relationships built through public replies are often brought into private chats. Once you’ve established rapport with somebody by sharing ideas and replying to each other, feel free to direct message them. Be kind. Introduce yourself. Show interest in their work. In fact, this is how I meet most of my closest friends. Through Twitter DMs, I’ve also met professional athletes, famous entrepreneurs, and New York Times bestselling authors. 
    - Tweeting is the price of entry. But direct messages make Twitter memorable. 
    - “Twitter is the most amazing networking and learning network ever built. For someone who’s pursuing their dream job or chasing a group of mentors or peers, it’s remarkable. In any given field, 50-80% of the top experts in that field are on Twitter and they’re sharing ideas, and you can connect to them or follow them in your personal feed. If you get lucky enough and say something they find interesting, they might follow you, and the reason this becomes super interesting is that unlocks direct message, and now all of a sudden you can communicate directly or electronically with that individual. Very, very powerful. If you’re not using Twitter, you’re missing out.”

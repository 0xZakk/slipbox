    - Wanted to quickly weigh in on this @dhh vs. @Austen debate on bootstrapping vs. VC:

In 2010, @moskov told me (in the nicest possible terms) that Asana would destroy Flow due to its massive capital advantage... 
    - Despite having top venture investors barking at the door, I had been drinking the @dhh Koolaid and thought raising VC was universally bad... 
    - In reality, it's nuanced and highly situationally. 

...which I learned the hard way as Asana systematically outspent us on all channels and ate the market, then eventually caught up on product. 

Flow had a $5k/mo marketing budget when Asana was spending like $250k+/mo... 
    - Flow was still successful, but today it owns a single digit percentage market share when it easily could be at 5%-15% had we leaned in more aggressively and raised money.

It was a super expensive lesson for me and drove home that there are situations where venture makes sense... 
    - That said: I'm SO glad I took the @dhh/@jasonfried bootstrap approach globally.

Had we taken venture, I wouldn't have been able to diversify across companies.

With far less risk, we ended up doing very well, and Chris and I own 80-100% of the equity in most of our businesses... 
    - 80% chance of reasonable success bootstrapping vs. 10% chance in venture. At best.

Also need to keep in mind that often CEOs of $1BN+ venture backed businesses only retain 5-15%.

But at the end of the day, it comes down to risk profile. I don't like a lot of risk ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

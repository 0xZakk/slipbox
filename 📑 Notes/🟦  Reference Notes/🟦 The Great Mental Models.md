    - The quality of your thinking depends on the models that are in your head. 
    - I believe in the discipline of mastering the best of what other people have figured out. Charlie Munger1 
    - Introduction: Acquiring Wisdom 
    - In life and business, the person with the fewest blind spots wins. Removing blind spots means we see, interact with, and move closer to understanding reality. We think better. And thinking better is about finding simple processes that help us work through problems from multiple dimensions and perspectives, allowing us to better choose solutions that fit what matters to us. The skill for finding the right solutions for the right problems is one form of wisdom. 
    - While we can‚Äôt predict which problems will inevitably crop up in life, we can learn time-tested ideas that help us prepare for whatever the world throws at us. 
    - Peter Bevelin, put it best: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be a great problem solver. I want to avoid problems‚Äîprevent them from happening and doing it right from the beginning.‚Äù 
    - Mental models describe the way the world works. They shape how we think, how we understand, and how we form beliefs. Largely subconscious, mental models operate below the surface. We‚Äôre not generally aware of them and yet they‚Äôre the reason when we look at a problem we consider some factors relevant and others irrelevant. They are how we infer causality, match patterns, and draw analogies. They are how we think and reason. 
    - A mental model is simply a representation of how something works. We cannot keep all of the details of the world in our brains, so we use models to simplify the complex into understandable and organizable chunks. Whether we realize it or not, we then use these models every day to think, decide, and understand our world. 
    - In order to see a problem for what it is, we must first break it down into its substantive parts so the interconnections can reveal themselves. This bottom-up perspective allows us to expose what we believe to be the causal relationships and how they will govern the situation both now and in the future. Being able to accurately describe the full scope of a situation is the first step to understanding it. Using the lenses of our mental models helps us illuminate these interconnections. The more lenses used on a given problem, the more of reality reveals itself. The more of reality we see, the more we understand. The more we understand, the more we know what to do. 
    - When understanding is separated from reality, we lose our powers. Understanding must constantly be tested against reality and updated accordingly. This isn‚Äôt a box we can tick, a task with a definite beginning and end, but a continuous process. 
    - Our failures to update from interacting with reality spring primarily from three things: not having the right perspective or vantage point, ego-induced denial, and distance from the consequences of our decisions. 
    - Most geniuses‚Äîespecially those who lead others‚Äîprosper not by deconstructing intricate complexities but by exploiting unrecognized simplicities. ¬ª Andy Benoit 
    - However, understanding reality is not everything. The pursuit of understanding fuels meaning and adaptation, but this understanding, by itself, is not enough. Understanding only becomes useful when we adjust our behavior and actions accordingly. 
    - In the real world you will either understand and adapt to find success or you will fail 
    - We are passive, thinking these things just happened to us and not that we did something to cause them. This passivity means that we rarely reflect on our decisions and the outcomes. Without reflection we cannot learn. Without learning we are doomed to repeat mistakes, become frustrated when the world doesn‚Äôt work the way we want it to, and wonder why we are so busy. The cycle goes on. 
    - Sometimes making good decisions boils down to avoiding bad ones. 
    - When it comes to applying mental models we tend to run into trouble either when our model of reality is wrong, that is, it doesn‚Äôt survive real world experience, or when our model is right and we apply it to a situation where it doesn‚Äôt belong. 
    - The quality of our thinking is largely influenced by the mental models in our heads. While we want accurate models, we also want a wide variety of models to uncover what‚Äôs really happening. 
    - ‚ÄúEvery statistician knows that a large, relevant sample size is their best friend. What are the three largest, most relevant sample sizes for identifying universal principles? Bucket number one is inorganic systems, which are 13.7 billion years in size. It‚Äôs all the laws of math and physics, the entire physical universe. Bucket number two is organic systems, 3.5 billion years of biology on Earth. And bucket number three is human history, you can pick your own number, I picked 20,000 years of recorded human behavior. Those are the three largest sample sizes we can access and the most relevant.‚Äù ‚ÄîPeter Kaufman 
    - In a famous speech in the 1990s, Charlie Munger summed up this approach to practical wisdom: ‚ÄúWell, the first rule is that you can‚Äôt really know anything if you just remember isolated facts and try and bang ‚Äòem back. If the facts don‚Äôt hang together on a latticework of theory, you don‚Äôt have them in a usable form. You‚Äôve got to have models in your head. And you‚Äôve got to array your experience both vicarious and direct on this latticework of models. You may have noticed students who just try to remember and pound back what is remembered. Well, they fail in school and in life. You‚Äôve got to hang experience on a latticework of models in your head.‚Äù 
    - To quote Charlie Munger, ‚Äú80 or 90 important models will carry about 90 percent of the freight in making you a worldly-wise person. And, of those, only a mere handful really carry very heavy freight.‚Äù10 
    - The more high-quality mental models you have in your mental toolbox, the more likely you will have the ones needed to understand the problem. And understanding is everything. The better you understand, the better the potential actions you can take. The better the potential actions, the fewer problems you‚Äôll encounter down the road. 
    - Better models make better decisions. 
    - The map of reality is not reality. Even the best maps are imperfect. That‚Äôs because they are reductions of what they represent. If a map were to represent the territory with perfect fidelity, it would no longer be a reduction and thus would no longer be useful to us. 
    - The Map is not the Territory 
    - Just because maps and models are flawed is not an excuse to ignore them. Maps are useful to the extent they are explanatory and predictive. 
    - map is not the territory. In other words, the description of the thing is not the thing itself. 
    - The abstraction is not the abstracted. 
    - The truth is, the only way we can navigate the complexity of reality is through some sort of abstraction. 
    - We run into problems when our knowledge becomes of the map, rather than the actual underlying territory it describes. 
    - Reality is messy and complicated, so our tendency to simplify it is understandable. However, if the aim becomes simplification rather than understanding we start to make bad decisions. 
    - We can‚Äôt use maps as dogma. Maps and models are not meant to live forever as static references. The world is dynamic. As territories change, our tools to navigate them must be flexible to handle a wide variety of situations or adapt to the changing times. 
    - In order to use a map or model as accurately as possible, we should take three important considerations into account: Reality is the ultimate update. Consider the cartographer. Maps can influence territories.

    - Circle of Competence 
    - When you are honest about where your knowledge is lacking you know where you are vulnerable and where you can improve. Understanding your circle of competence improves decision-making and outcomes. 
    - What is a circle of competence? Imagine an old man who‚Äôs spent his entire life up in a small town. He‚Äôs the Lifer. No detail of the goings-on in the town has escaped his notice over the years. He knows the lineage, behavior, attitudes, jobs, income, and social status of every person in town. Bit by bit, he built that knowledge up over a long period of observation and participation in town affairs. The Lifer knows where the bodies are buried and who buried them. He knows who owes money to whom, who gets along with whom, and who the town depends on to keep spinning. He knows about that time the mayor cheated on his taxes. He knows about that time the town flooded, how many inches high the water was, and exactly who helped whom and who didn‚Äôt. Now imagine a Stranger enters the town, in from the Big City. Within a few days, the Stranger decides that he knows all there is to know about the town. He‚Äôs met the mayor, the sheriff, the bartender, and the shopkeeper, and he can get around fairly easily. It‚Äôs a small town and he hasn‚Äôt come across anything surprising. In the Stranger‚Äôs mind, he‚Äôs convinced he pretty much knows everything a Lifer would know. He has sized up the town in no time, with his keen eye. He makes assumptions based on what he has learned so far, and figures he knows enough to get his business done. This, however, is a false sense of confidence that likely causes him to take more risks than he realizes. Without intimately knowing the history of the town, how can he be sure that he has picked the right land for development, or negotiated the best price? After all, what kind of knowledge does he really have, compared to the Lifer? The difference between the detailed web of knowledge in the Lifer‚Äôs head and the surface knowledge in the Stranger‚Äôs head is the difference between being inside a circle of competence and being outside the perimeter. 
    - True knowledge of a complex territory cannot be faked. 
    - How do you know when you have a circle of competence? Within our circles of competence, we know exactly what we don‚Äôt know. We are able to make decisions quickly and relatively accurately. We possess detailed knowledge of additional information we might need to make a decision with full understanding, or even what information is unobtainable. We know what is knowable and what is unknowable and can distinguish between the two. We can anticipate and respond to objections because we‚Äôve heard them before and already put in the work of gaining the knowledge to counter them. We also have a lot of options when we confront problems in our circles. Our deep fluency in subjects we are dealing with means we can draw on different information resources and understand what can be adjusted and what is invariant. A circle of competence cannot be built quickly. We don‚Äôt become Lifers overnight. It isn‚Äôt the result of taking a few courses or working at something for a few months‚Äîbeing 
    - Building a circle of competence takes years of experience, of making mistakes, and of actively seeking out better methods of practice and thought. 
    - How do you build and maintain a circle of competence? One of the essential requirements of a circle of competence is that you can never take it for granted. You can‚Äôt operate as if a circle of competence is a static thing, that once attained is attained for life. The world is dynamic. Knowledge gets updated, and so too must your circle. There are three key practices needed in order to build and maintain a circle of competence: curiosity and a desire to learn, monitoring, and feedback. First, you have to be willing to learn. Learning comes when experience meets reflection. You can learn from your own experiences. Or you can learn from the experience of others, through books, articles, and conversations. Learning everything on your own is costly and slow. You are one person. Learning from the experiences of others is much more productive. You need to always approach your circle with curiosity, seeking out information that can help you expand and strengthen it. ¬´Learn from the mistakes of others. You can‚Äôt live long enough to make them all yourself.¬ª Anonymous Second, you need to monitor your track record in areas which you have, or want to have, a circle of competence. And you need to have the courage to monitor honestly so the feedback can be used to your advantage. The reason we have such difficulty with overconfidence‚Äîas demonstrated in studies which show that most of us are much worse drivers, lovers, managers, traders (and many other things) than we think we are‚Äîis because we have a problem with honest self-reporting. We don‚Äôt keep the right records, because we don‚Äôt really want to know what we‚Äôre good and bad at. Ego is a powerful enemy when it comes to better understanding reality. But that won‚Äôt work if you‚Äôre trying to assess or build your circle of competence. You need to keep a precise diary of your trades, if you‚Äôre investing in the stock market. If you are in a leadership position, you need to observe and chronicle the results of your decisions and evaluate them based on what you were trying to achieve. You need to be honest about your failures in order to reflect and learn from them. That‚Äôs what it takes. Keeping a journal of your own performance is the easiest and most private way to give self-feedback. Journals allow you to step out of your automatic thinking and ask yourself: What went wrong? How could I do better? Monitoring your own‚Ä¶ 
    - There are three parts to successfully operating outside a circle of competence: Learn at least the basics of the realm you‚Äôre operating in, while acknowledging that you‚Äôre a Stranger, not a Lifer. However, keep in mind that basic information is easy to obtain and often gives the acquirer an unwarranted confidence. Talk to someone whose circle of competence in the area is strong. Take the time to do a bit of research to at least define questions you need to ask, and what information you need, to make a good decision. If you ask a person to answer the question for you, they‚Äôll be giving you a fish. If you ask them detailed and thoughtful questions, you‚Äôll learn how to fish. Furthermore, when you need the advice of others, especially in higher stakes situations, ask questions to probe the limits of their circles. Then ask yourself how the situation might influence the information they choose to provide you. Use a broad understanding of the basic mental models of the world to augment your limited understanding of the field in which you find yourself a Stranger. These will help you identify the foundational concepts that would be most useful. These then serve as a guide to help you navigate the situation you are in. 
    - When Queen Elizabeth I of England ascended to the throne, her reign was by no means assured. The tumultuous years under her father, brother, and sister had contributed to a political situation that was precarious at best. England was in a religious crisis that was threatening the stability of the kingdom, and was essentially broke. Elizabeth knew there were aspects of leading the country that were outside her circle of competence. She had an excellent education and had spent most of her life just trying to survive. Perhaps that is why she was able to identify and admit to what she didn‚Äôt know. In her first speech as Queen, Elizabeth announced, ‚ÄúI mean to direct all my actions by good advice and counsel.‚Äù9 After outlining her intent upon becoming Queen, she proceeded to build her Privy Council‚Äîeffectively the royal advisory board. She didn‚Äôt copy her immediate predecessors, filling her council with yes men or wealthy incompetents who happen to have the same religious values. She blended the old and the new to develop stability and achieve continuity. She kept the group small so that real discussions could happen. She wanted a variety of opinions that could be challenged and debated.10 In large measure due to the advice she received from this council, advice that was the product of open debate that took in the circles of competence of each of the participants, Elizabeth took England from a country of civil unrest and frequent persecution to one that inspired loyalty and creativity in its citizens. She sowed the seeds for the empire that would eventually come to control one quarter of the globe.

story of queen elizabeth and how she transformed the country
    - It is also important to remember that no one can have a circle of competence that encompasses everything. There is only so much you can know with great depth of understanding. This is why being able to identify your circle, and knowing how to move around outside of it, is so important. 
    - Staying in Your Circle The idea a circle of competence in the realm of investments was stated very well by Berkshire Hathaway‚Äôs Warren Buffett. When asked, he recommended that each individual stick to their area of special competence, and be very reluctant to stray. For when we stray too far, we get into areas where we don‚Äôt even know what we don‚Äôt know. We may not even know the questions we need to ask. To explain his point, Buffett gives the example of a Russian immigrant woman who ran one of his businesses, the famous Nebraska Furniture Mart. The CEO, Rose Blumkin, spoke little English and could barely read or write, yet had a head for two things: numbers, and home furnishings. She stuck to those areas and built one of the country‚Äôs great retailing establishments. Here it is in Buffett‚Äôs words: I couldn‚Äôt have given her $200 million worth of Berkshire Hathaway stock when I bought the business because she doesn‚Äôt understand stock. She understands cash. She understands furniture. She understands real estate. She doesn‚Äôt understand stocks, so she doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with them. If you deal with Mrs. B in what I would call her circle of competence‚Ä¶. She is going to buy 5,000 end tables this afternoon (if the price is right). She is going to buy 20 different carpets in odd lots, and everything else like that [snaps fingers] because she understands carpets. She wouldn‚Äôt buy 100 shares of General Motors if it was at 50 cents a share.12 Her iron focus on the things she knew best was largely responsible for her massive success in spite of the obstacles she faced. 
    - Supporting Idea: Falsifiability 
    - Trend is not destiny. Even if we can derive and understand certain laws of human biological nature, the trends of history itself are dependent on conditions, and conditions change. Bertrand Russell‚Äôs classic example of the chicken that gets fed every day is a great illustration of this concept.14 Daily feedings have been going on for as long as the chicken has observed, and thus it supposes that these feedings are a guaranteed part of its life and will continue in perpetuity. The feedings appear as a law until the day the chicken gets its head chopped off. They are then revealed to be a trend, not a predictor of the future state of affairs. 
    - First Principles Thinking 
    - First principles thinking is one of the best ways to reverse-engineer complicated situations and unleash creative possibility. Sometimes called reasoning from first principles, it‚Äôs a tool to help clarify complicated problems by separating the underlying ideas or facts from any assumptions based on them. What remain are the essentials. If you know the first principles of something, you can build the rest of your knowledge around them to produce something new. 
    - If we want to identify the principles in a situation to cut through the dogma and the shared belief, there are two techniques we can use: Socratic questioning and the Five Whys. 
    - Socratic questioning can be used to establish first principles through stringent analysis. This is a disciplined questioning process, used to establish truths, reveal underlying assumptions, and separate knowledge from ignorance. The key distinction between Socratic questioning and ordinary discussions is that the former seeks to draw out first principles in a systematic manner. Socratic questioning generally follows this process: Clarifying your thinking and explaining the origins of your ideas. (Why do I think this? What exactly do I think?) Challenging assumptions. (How do I know this is true? What if I thought the opposite?) Looking for evidence. (How can I back this up? What are the sources?) Considering alternative perspectives. (What might others think? How do I know I am correct?) Examining consequences and implications. (What if I am wrong? What are the consequences if I am?) Questioning the original questions. (Why did I think that? Was I correct? What conclusions can I draw from the reasoning process?) Socratic questioning stops you from relying on your gut and limits strong emotional responses. This process helps you build something that lasts. 
    - The Five Whys is a method rooted in the behavior of children. Children instinctively think in first principles. Just like us, they want to understand what‚Äôs happening in the world. To do so, they intuitively break through the fog with a game some parents have come to dread, but which is exceptionally useful for identifying first principles: repeatedly asking ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù The goal of the Five Whys is to land on a ‚Äúwhat‚Äù or ‚Äúhow‚Äù. It is not about introspection, such as ‚ÄúWhy do I feel like this?‚Äù Rather, it is about systematically delving further into a statement or concept so that you can separate reliable knowledge from assumption. If your ‚Äúwhys‚Äù result in a statement of falsifiable fact, you have hit a first principle. If they end up with a ‚Äúbecause I said so‚Äù or ‚Äùit just is‚Äù, you know you have landed on an assumption that may be based on popular opinion, cultural myth, or dogma. These are not first principles. 
    - ¬´Science is much more than a body of knowledge. It is a way of thinking.¬ª Carl Sagan2 
    - Thought Experiment 
    - Thought experiments can be defined as ‚Äúdevices of the imagination used to investigate the nature of things.‚Äù1 Many disciplines, such as philosophy and physics, make use of thought experiments to examine what can be known. In doing so, they can open up new avenues for inquiry and exploration. Thought experiments are powerful because they help us learn from our mistakes and avoid future ones. They let us take on the impossible, evaluate the potential consequences of our actions, and re-examine history to make better decisions. They can help us both figure out what we really want, and the best way to get there. 
    - A better way to answer the ‚Äúwho would win‚Äù question is through a remarkable ability of the human brain‚Äîthe ability to conduct a detailed thought experiment. Its chief value is that it lets us do things in our heads we cannot do in real life, and so explore situations from more angles than we can physically examine and test for. Thought experiments are more than daydreaming. They require the same rigor as a traditional experiment in order to be useful. Much like the scientific method, a thought experiment generally has the following steps: Ask a question Conduct background research Construct hypothesis Test with (thought) experiments Analyze outcomes and draw conclusions Compare to hypothesis and adjust accordingly (new question, 
    - One of the real powers of the thought experiment is that there is no limit to the number of times you can change a variable to see if it influences the outcome. In order to place that bet, you would want to estimate in how many possible basketball games does Woody Allen beat LeBron James. Out of 100,000 game scenarios, Allen probably only wins in the few where LeBron starts the game by having a deadly heart attack. Experimenting to discover the full spectrum of possible outcomes gives you a better appreciation for what you can influence and what you can reasonably expect to happen. 
    - Let‚Äôs now explore few areas in which thought experiments are tremendously useful. Imagining physical impossibilities Re-imagining history Intuiting the non-intuitive 
    - Intuiting the non-intuitive: One of the uses of thought experiments is to improve our ability to intuit the non-intuitive. In other words, a thought experiment allows us to verify if our natural intuition is correct by running experiments in our deliberate, conscious minds that make a point clear.

    - Necessity and Sufficiency 
    - We often make the mistake of assuming that having some necessary conditions in place means that we have all of the sufficient conditions in place for our desired event or effect to occur. The gap between the two is the difference between becoming a published author and becoming J.K. Rowling. Certainly you have to know how to write well to become either, but it isn‚Äôt sufficient to become a Rowling. This is somewhat obvious to most. What‚Äôs not obvious is that the gap between what is necessary to succeed and what is sufficient is often luck, chance, or some other factor beyond your direct control. Assume you wanted to make it into the Fortune 500. Capital is necessary, but not sufficient. Hard work is necessary, but not sufficient. Intelligence is necessary, but not sufficient. Billionaire success takes all of those things and more, plus a lot of luck. That‚Äôs a big reason that there‚Äôs no recipe. 
    - Technology is fine, but the scientists and engineers only partially think through their problems. They solve certain aspects, but not the total, and as a consequence it is slapping us back in the face very hard. Barbara McClintock 
    - Second-Order Thinking 
    - Almost everyone can anticipate the immediate results of their actions. This type of first-order thinking is easy and safe but it‚Äôs also a way to ensure you get the same results that everyone else gets. Second-order thinking is thinking farther ahead and thinking holistically. It requires us to not only consider our actions and their immediate consequences, but the subsequent effects of those actions as well. Failing to consider the second- and third-order effects can unleash disaster. 
    - We see examples of this throughout history. During their colonial rule of India, the British government began to worry about the number of venomous cobras in Delhi. To reduce the numbers, they instituted a reward for every dead snake brought to officials. In response, Indian citizens dutifully complied and began breeding the snakes to slaughter and bring to officials. The snake problem was worse than when it started because the British officials didn‚Äôt think at the second level. 
    - In 1963, the UC Santa Barbara ecologist and economist Garrett Hardin proposed his First Law of Ecology: ‚ÄúYou can never merely do one thing.‚Äù3 We operate in a world of multiple, overlapping connections, like a web, with many significant, yet obscure and unpredictable, relationships. He developed second-order thinking into a tool, showing that if you don‚Äôt consider ‚Äúthe effects of the effects,‚Äù you can‚Äôt really claim to be doing any thinking at all. 
    - Let‚Äôs look at two areas where second-order thinking can be used to great benefit: Prioritizing long-term interests over immediate gains Constructing effective arguments Second-order thinking and realizing long-term interests: This is a useful model for seeing past immediate gains to identify long-term effects we want. This is often a conflict for us, as when we choose to forgo the immediate pleasure of candy to improve our long-term health. The first-order effect is this amazing feeling triggered by pure sugar. But what are the second-order effects of regular candy consumption? Is this what I want my body or life to look like in ten years? Second-order thinking involves asking ourselves if what we are doing now is going to get us the results we want.

    - Constructing an effective argument: Second-order thinking can help you avert problems and anticipate challenges that you can then address in advance. For example, most of us have to construct arguments every day. Convincing your boss to take a chance on a new form of outreach, convincing your spouse to try a new parenting technique. Life is filled with the need to be persuasive. Arguments are more effective when we demonstrate that we have considered the second-order effects and put effort into verifying that these are desirable as well. 
    - A word of caution Second-order thinking, as valuable as it is, must be tempered in one important way: You can‚Äôt let it lead to the paralysis of the Slippery Slope Effect, the idea that if we start with action A, everything after is a slippery slope down to hell, with a chain of consequences B, C, D, E, and F.

    - We don‚Äôt make decisions in a vacuum and we can‚Äôt get something for nothing. When making choices, considering consequences can help us avoid future problems. We must ask ourselves the critical question: And then what? Consequences come in many varieties, some more tangible than others. Thinking in terms of the system in which you are operating will allow you to see that your consequences have consequences. Thinking through a problem as far as you can with the information you have allows us to consider time, scale, thresholds, and more. And weighing different paths is what thinking is all about. A little time spent thinking ahead can save us massive amounts of time later. 
    - The theory of probability is the only mathematical tool available to help map the unknown and the uncontrollable. It is fortunate that this tool, while tricky, is extraordinarily powerful and convenient. Benoit Mandelbrot1 
    - Probabilistic Thinking 
    - Probabilistic thinking is essentially trying to estimate, using some tools of math and logic, the likelihood of any specific outcome coming to pass. It is one of the best tools we have to improve the accuracy of our decisions. In a world where each moment is determined by an infinitely complex set of factors, probabilistic thinking helps us identify the most likely outcomes. When we know these our decisions can be more precise and effective. 
    - Our lack of perfect information about the world gives rise to all of probability theory, and its usefulness. We know now that the future is inherently unpredictable because not all variables can be known and even the smallest error imaginable in our data very quickly throws off our predictions. The best we can do is estimate the future by generating realistic, useful probabilities. So how do we do that? Probability is everywhere, down to the very bones of the world. The probabilistic machinery in our minds‚Äîthe cut-to-the-quick heuristics made so famous by the psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky‚Äîwas evolved by the human species in a time before computers, factories, traffic, middle managers, and the stock market. It served us in a time when human life was about survival, and still serves us well in that capacity.2 
    - There are three important aspects of probability that we need to explain so you can integrate them into your thinking to get into the ballpark and improve your chances of catching the ball: Bayesian thinking Fat-tailed curves Asymmetries 
    - The core of Bayesian thinking (or Bayesian updating, as it can be called) is this: given that we have limited but useful information about the world, and are constantly encountering new information, we should probably take into account what we already know when we learn something new. As much of it as possible. Bayesian thinking allows us to use all relevant prior information in making decisions. Statisticians might call it a base rate, taking in outside information about past situations like the one you‚Äôre in. 
    - It is important to remember that priors themselves are probability estimates. For each bit of prior knowledge, you are not putting it in a binary structure, saying it is true or not. You‚Äôre assigning it a probability of being true. Therefore, you can‚Äôt let your priors get in the way of processing new knowledge. In Bayesian terms, this is called the likelihood ratio or the Bayes factor. Any new information you encounter that challenges a prior simply means that the probability of that prior being true may be reduced. Eventually some priors are replaced completely. This is an ongoing cycle of challenging and validating what you believe you know. When making uncertain decisions, it‚Äôs nearly always a mistake not to ask: What are the relevant priors? What might I already know that I can use to better understand the reality of the situation? 
    - Conditional Probability Conditional probability is similar to Bayesian thinking in practice, but comes at it from a different angle. When you use historical events to predict the future, you have to be mindful of the conditions that surrounded that event. Events can be independent, like tossing a coin, or dependent. In the latter case, it means the outcomes of an event are conditional on what preceded them. Let‚Äôs say the last three times I‚Äôve hung out with you and we‚Äôve gone for ice cream, I‚Äôve picked vanilla. Do you conclude that vanilla is my favorite, and thus I will always choose it? You want to check first if my choosing vanilla is independent or dependent. Am I the first to choose from 100 flavors? Or am I further down the line, when chocolate is no longer available? My ice cream choice is independent if all the flavors are available each time someone in my group makes a choice. It is dependent if the preceding choices of my friends reduce what is available to me. In this case, the probability of my choosing vanilla is conditional on what is left after my friends make their choices. Thus, using conditional probability means being very careful to observe the conditions preceding an event you‚Äôd like to understand. 
    - Now we need to look at fat-tailed curves: Many of us are familiar with the bell curve, that nice, symmetrical wave that captures the relative frequency of so many things from height to exam scores. The bell curve is great because it‚Äôs easy to understand and easy to use. Its technical name is ‚Äúnormal distribution.‚Äù If we know we are in a bell curve situation, we can quickly identify our parameters and plan for the most likely outcomes. Fat-tailed curves are different. Take a look. At first glance they seem similar enough. Common outcomes cluster together, creating a wave. The difference is in the tails. In a bell curve the extremes are predictable. There can only be so much deviation from the mean. In a fat-tailed curve there is no real cap on extreme events. The more extreme events that are possible, the longer the tails of the curve get. Any one extreme event is still unlikely, but the sheer number of options means that we can‚Äôt rely‚Ä¶ 
    - Think of it this way. In a bell curve type of situation, like displaying the distribution of height or weight in a human population, there are outliers on the spectrum of possibility, but the outliers have a fairly well-defined scope. You‚Äôll never meet a man who is ten times the size of an average man. But in a curve with fat tails, like wealth, the central tendency does not work the same way. You may regularly meet people‚Ä¶ 
    - The important thing is not to sit down and imagine every possible scenario in the tail (by definition, it is impossible) but to deal with fat-tailed domains in the correct way: by positioning ourselves to survive or even benefit from the wildly unpredictable future, by being the only ones thinking correctly and planning for a world we don‚Äôt fully understand. 
    - Asymmetries: Finally, you need to think about something we might call ‚Äúmetaprobability‚Äù‚Äîthe probability that your probability estimates themselves are any good. This massively misunderstood concept has to do with asymmetries. If you look at nicely polished stock pitches made by professional investors, nearly every time an idea is presented, the investor looks their audience in the eye and states they think they‚Äôre going to achieve a rate of return of 20% to 40% per annum, if not higher. Yet exceedingly few of them ever attain that mark, and it‚Äôs not because they don‚Äôt have any winners. It‚Äôs because they get so many so wrong. They consistently overestimate their confidence in their probabilistic estimates. (For reference, the general stock market has returned no more than 7% to 8% per annum in the United States over a long period, before fees.) 
    - Orders of Magnitude Nassim Taleb puts his finger in the right place when he points out our naive use of probabilities. In The Black Swan, he argues that any small error in measuring the risk of an extreme event can mean we‚Äôre not just slightly off, but way off‚Äîoff by orders of magnitude, in fact. In other words, not just 10% wrong but ten times wrong, or 100 times wrong, or 1,000 times wrong. Something we thought could only happen every 1,000 years might be likely to happen in any given year! This‚Ä¶ 
    - Anti-fragility How do we benefit from the uncertainty of a world we don‚Äôt understand, one dominated by ‚Äúfat tails‚Äù? The answer to this was provided by Nassim Taleb in a book curiously titled Antifragile. Here is the core of the idea. We can think about three categories of objects: Ones that are harmed by volatility and unpredictability, ones that are neutral to volatility and unpredictability, and finally, ones that benefit from it. The latter category is antifragile‚Äîlike a package that wants to be mishandled. Up to a point, certain things benefit from volatility, and that‚Äôs how we want to be. Why? Because the world is fundamentally unpredictable and volatile, and large events‚Äîpanics, crashes, wars, bubbles, and so on‚Äîtend to have a disproportionate impact on outcomes. There are two ways to handle such a world: try to predict, or try to prepare. Prediction is tempting. For all of human history, seers and soothsayers have turned a comfortable trade. The problem is that nearly all studies of ‚Äúexpert‚Äù predictions in such complex real-world realms as the stock market, geopolitics, and global finance have proven again and again that, for the rare and impactful events in our world, predicting is impossible! It‚Äôs more efficient to prepare. What are some ways we can prepare‚Äîarm ourselves with antifragility‚Äîso we can benefit from the volatility of the world? The first one is what Wall Street traders would call ‚Äúupside optionality‚Äù, that is, seeking out situations that we expect have good odds of offering us opportunities. Take the example of attending a cocktail party where a lot of people you might like to know are in attendance. While nothing is guaranteed to happen‚Äîyou may not meet those people, and if you do, it may not go well‚Äî you give yourself the benefit of serendipity and randomness. The worst thing that can happen is...nothing. One thing you know for sure is that you‚Äôll never meet them sitting at home. By going to the party, you improve your odds of encountering opportunity. The second thing we can do is to learn how to fail properly. Failing properly has two major components. First, never take a risk that will do you in completely. (Never get taken out of the game completely.) Second, develop the personal resilience to learn from your failures and start again. With these two rules, you can only fail temporarily. No one likes to fail. It hurts. But‚Ä¶ 
    - Another common asymmetry is people‚Äôs ability to estimate the effect of traffic on travel time. How often do you leave ‚Äúon time‚Äù and arrive 20% early? Almost never? How often do you leave ‚Äúon time‚Äù and arrive 20% late? All the time? Exactly. Your estimation errors are asymmetric, skewing in a single direction. This is often the case with probabilistic decision-making. Far more probability estimates are wrong on the ‚Äúover-optimistic‚Äù side than the ‚Äúunder-optimistic‚Äù side. You‚Äôll rarely read about an investor who aimed for 25% annual return rates who subsequently earned 40% over a long period of time. You‚Ä¶

    - Insurance Companies The most probability-acute businesses in the world are insurance companies‚Äîbecause they must be. When we think of insurance, we might think of life insurance (the probability of a policyholder dying at a certain age), or auto insurance (the probability of being in a car accident), or maybe home insurance (the probability of a tree falling on the house). With the statistics available to us, the probabilities of these things are easy to price and predict across a large enough population. But insurance is deeply wide-ranging, and insurers will insure almost any event, for a price. Insurance policies have been taken out on Victoria‚Äôs Secret models‚Äô legs, on baseball players‚Äô arms, on the Pepsi Challenge and the NCAA tournament, and even on a famous country singer‚Äôs breasts! How is this possible? Only with a close attention to probability. What the great insurance companies in the world know how to do is pay attention to the important factors, even if they‚Äôre not totally predictable, and price accordingly. What is the probability of a Victoria‚Äôs Secret model injuring her legs badly enough to end her career? One in 10,000? One in 100,000? Getting it right would mean evaluating her lifestyle, her habits, her health, her family history‚Äîand coming up with a price and a set of conditions that are good enough to provide a profit on average. It‚Äôs not unlike handicapping a race at the horse tracks. You can always say yes to insuring, but the trick is to come up with the right price. And for that we need probability. 
    - Causation vs. Correlation 
    - Confusion between these two terms often leads to a lot of inaccurate assumptions about the way the world works. We notice two things happening at the same time (correlation) and mistakenly conclude that one causes the other (causation). We then often act upon that erroneous conclusion, making decisions that can have immense influence across our lives. The problem is, without a good understanding of what is meant by these terms, these decisions fail to capitalize on real dynamics in the world and instead are successful only by luck. 
    - No Correlation The correlation coefficient between two measures, which varies between -1 and 1, is a measure of the relative weight of the factors they share. For example, two phenomena with few factors shared, such as bottled water consumption versus suicide rate, should have a correlation coefficient of close to 0. That is to say, if we looked at all countries in the world and plotted suicide rates of a specific year against per capita consumption of bottled water, the plot would show no pattern at all. 
    - Perfect Correlation On the contrary, there are measures which are solely dependent on the same factor. A good example of this is temperature. The only factor governing temperature‚Äîvelocity of molecules‚Äîis shared by all scales. Thus each degree in Celsius will have exactly one corresponding value in Fahrenheit. Therefore temperature in Celsius and Fahrenheit will have a correlation coefficient of 1 and the plot will be a straight line. 
    - Weak to Moderate Correlation There are few phenomena in human sciences that have a correlation coefficient of 1. There are, however, plenty where the association is weak to moderate and there is some explanatory power between the two phenomena. Consider the correlation between height and weight, which would land somewhere between 0 and 1. While virtually every three-year-old will be lighter and shorter than every grown man, not all grown men or three-year-olds of the same height will weigh the same. This variation and the corresponding lower degree of correlation implies that, while height is generally speaking a good predictor, there clearly are factors other than height at play. 
    - Causation Whenever correlation is imperfect, extremes will soften over time. The best will always appear to get worse and the worst will appear to get better, regardless of any additional action. This is called regression to the mean, and it means we have to be extra careful when diagnosing causation. This is something that the general media and sometimes even trained scientists fail to recognize. Consider the example Daniel Kahneman gives in Thinking Fast and Slow:5 Depressed children treated with an energy drink improve significantly over a three-month period. I made up this newspaper headline, but the fact it reports is true: if you treated a group of depressed children for some time with an energy drink, they would show a clinically significant improvement. It is also the case that depressed children who spend some time standing on their head or hug a cat for twenty minutes a day will also show improvement. Whenever coming across such headlines it is very tempting to jump to the conclusion that energy drinks, standing on the head, or hugging cats are all perfectly viable cures for depression. These cases, however, once again embody the regression to the mean: Depressed children are an extreme group, they are more depressed than most other children‚Äîand extreme groups regress to the mean over time. The correlation between depression scores on successive occasions of testing is less than perfect, so there will be regression to the mean: depressed children will get somewhat better over time even if they hug no cats and drink no Red Bull. We often mistakenly attribute a specific policy or treatment as the cause of an effect, when the change in the extreme groups would have happened anyway. This presents a fundamental problem: how can we know if the effects are real or simply due to variability? Luckily there is a way to tell between a real improvement and something that would have happened anyway. That is the introduction of the so-called control group, which is expected to improve by regression alone. The aim of the research is to determine whether the treated group improves more than regression can explain. 
    - The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposing ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function. One should, for example, be able to see that things are hopeless yet be determined to make them otherwise. F. Scott Fitzgerald 
    - Inversion 
    - Inversion is a powerful tool to improve your thinking because it helps you identify and remove obstacles to success. The root of inversion is ‚Äúinvert,‚Äù which means to upend or turn upside down. As a thinking tool it means approaching a situation from the opposite end of the natural starting point. Most of us tend to think one way about a problem: forward. Inversion allows us to flip the problem around and think backward. Sometimes it‚Äôs good to start at the beginning, but it can be more useful to start at the end. Think of it this way: Avoiding stupidity is easier than seeking brilliance. Combining the ability to think forward and backward allows you to see reality from multiple angles. 
    - There are two approaches to applying inversion in your life. Start by assuming that what you‚Äôre trying to prove is either true or false, then show what else would have to be true. Instead of aiming directly for your goal, think deeply about what you want to avoid and then see what options are left over. 
    - Mathematics is not the only area where using inversion can produce surprising and non-intuitive results. In the 1920s the American Tobacco Company wanted to sell more of their Lucky Strike cigarettes to women. Men were smoking, but women weren‚Äôt. There were pervasive taboos against women smoking‚Äîit was seen as a man‚Äôs activity. Women therefore presented an untapped market that had the potential of providing huge revenue. The head of the company thought that they needed to convince women that smoking would make them thinner, riding on the slimness trend that had already begun, so he hired Edward Bernays, who came up with a truly revolutionary marketing campaign.3,4 In the style of the inversion approach described above, Bernays did not ask, ‚ÄúHow do I sell more cigarettes to women?‚Äù Instead, he wondered, if women bought and smoked cigarettes, what else would have to be true? What would have to change in the world to make smoking desirable to women and socially acceptable? Then‚Äîa step farther‚Äîonce he knew what needed to change, how would he achieve that? 
    - The Most Successful Detective of All Time The first great detective to capture the public imagination was Sherlock Holmes. He solved cases in ways that were unfathomable to others, yet seemed obvious in retrospect. He gave the appearance of being a magician, but really he was an excellent observer. He was also a master of inversion. In his third case, ‚ÄúA Scandal in Bohemia,‚Äù5 Holmes is hired by a king to recover a compromising photograph in which the king appears with an American opera singer, Irene Adler. The king is fearful that Adler will use the picture of the two of them to prevent his upcoming marriage or to blackmail him in the future. He does not want to live under this threat, and so hires Sherlock Holmes to retrieve the picture from Adler. Presented with this task, what does Holmes do? What would you do? Does he study Adler for months to determine where, based on her personality, she is likely to hide the picture? Does he break into her house and perform a systematic exploration of every nook and cranny? No. Instead, he inverts the problem. If it is true that Adler has this compromising picture of the king and is planning to blackmail him, what would also be true? Likely that she would greatly value the photo as it will bring her money, and that it would be hidden in an accessible location so she could retrieve it in a hurry. We tend to keep our most prized possessions where we can easily grab them in case of emergency. So Holmes contrives a scenario in which he is able to be in her house while Watson creates an illusion of a fire on the street outside. Believing the threat, Adler takes the photo out of its hiding place before escaping. In one instant Holmes both confirms the existence of the photo and now knows its whereabouts. By starting with the logical outcome of his assumptions and seeking to validate those, he advances his case with significantly more efficiency and accuracy than if he had searched first for proof of the assumptions themselves. 
    - To tackle the idea of smoking as a slimming aid, he mounted a large anti-sweets campaign. After dinner, it was about cigarettes, not dessert. Cigarettes were slimming, while desserts would ruin one‚Äôs figure. But Bernays‚Äôs real stroke of genius lay not just in coming out with adverts to convince women to stay slim by smoking cigarettes; ‚Äúinstead, he sought nothing less than to reshape American society and culture.‚Äù6 He solicited journalists and photographers to promote the virtues of being slim. He sought testimonials from doctors about the health value of smoking after a meal. He combined this approach with ‚Ä¶altering the very environment, striving to create a world in which the cigarette was ubiquitous. He mounted a campaign to persuade hotels and restaurants to add cigarettes to dessert-list menus, and he provided such magazines as House and Garden with feature articles that included menus designed to preserve readers ‚Äòfrom the dangers of overeating‚Äô‚Ä¶. The idea was not only to influence opinion but to remold life itself. Bernays approached designers, architects, and cabinetmakers in an effort to persuade them to design kitchen cabinets that included special compartments for cigarettes, and he spoke to the manufacturers of kitchen containers to add‚Ä¶ 
    - This inversion approach became a staple of Bernays‚Äôs work. He used the descriptor ‚Äúappeals of indirection‚Äù, and each time when ‚Äúhired to sell a product or service, he instead sold whole new ways of behaving, which appeared obscure but over time reaped huge rewards for his clients and redefined the very texture of American life.‚Äù8 
    - One of the theoretical foundations for this type of thinking comes from psychologist Kurt Lewin.10 In the 1930s he came up with the idea of force field analysis, which essentially recognizes that in any situation where change is desired, successful management of that change requires applied inversion. Here is a brief explanation of his process: Identify the problem Define your objective Identify the forces that support change towards your objective Identify the forces that impede change towards the objective Strategize a solution! This may involve both augmenting or adding to the forces in step 3, and reducing or eliminating the forces in step 4. Even if we are quite logical, most of us stop after step 3. Once we figure out our objective, we focus on the things we need to put in place to make it happen, the new training or education, the messaging and marketing. But Lewin theorized that it can be just as powerful to remove obstacles to change. The inversion happens between steps 3 and 4. Whatever angle you choose to approach your problem from, you need to then follow with consideration of the opposite angle. Think about not only what you could do to solve a problem, but what you could do to make it worse‚Äîand then avoid doing that, or eliminate the conditions that perpetuate it. 
    - Inversion Leads to Innovation Using inversion to identify your end goal and work backward from there can lead to innovation. If you had to make a guess on who invented closed circuit television (CCTV) in the United States, whom would you choose? A large institution like the Department of Defense? A telecom company? Some techie in a police department? You probably wouldn‚Äôt name the late Marie Van Brittan Brown, who, along with her husband Albert Brown, filed the first patent for a closed circuit monitoring system in 1966. She was a nurse, living in the Jamaica neighborhood of Queens, New York, and as such worked irregular hours. When she was home alone, she felt unsafe. In an interesting example of inversion, she decided to do something about it. In the same situation, most of us would work forward, thinking of safety-oriented additions we can make to our existing set-up, like more locks, or having a friend stay over. Van Brittan Brown, however, went a step further, asking what would need to change in order for her to feel safer. She identified that it was her inability to see and communicate with persons outside her door that made her feel the most vulnerable when home alone. Working backward, her thinking may have gone something like this: what can I do to change that situation? What would have to be in place? Van Brittan Brown followed this through, and CCTV was born. Van Brittan Brown and her husband designed a camera system that would move between four holes in the door, feeding the images to a TV monitor set up in the home. The images would allow her to get a complete view of who was at the door, and additional technology allowed for communication with the person outside without the door being opened. Further, they developed a feature that would allow her to either let the person in, or sound an alarm to notify a neighbor or watchman. To be fair, we will likely never know the thought process that led Van Brittan Brown to develop and patent this technology, but her story demonstrates that working backward from a goal can spur the innovation to reach it.

    - Occam‚Äôs Razor 
    - Simpler explanations are more likely to be true than complicated ones. This is the essence of Occam‚Äôs Razor, a classic principle of logic and problem-solving. Instead of wasting your time trying to disprove complex scenarios, you can make decisions more confidently by basing them on the explanation that has the fewest moving parts. 
    - The principle was stated in another useful way by the 18th-century Scottish philosopher David Hume, in his famous Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding. Writing about the truth or untruth of miracles, Hume stated that we should default to skepticism about them.4 Why? It wasn‚Äôt simply that Hume was a buzzkill. He had a specific, Occam-like reason for being cautious about miracles. By definition, a miracle is something which has happened outside of our normal understanding of the way nature works. If the miracle was not outside of our common experience, we wouldn‚Äôt consider its occurrence miraculous. If there was a simple explanation for the occurrence based on mostly common knowledge, we likely wouldn‚Äôt pay much attention to it at all. Therefore, the most simple explanation for a miracle is that the miracle-witnesser is not describing the event correctly, or the miracle represents a more common phenomenon that we currently don‚Äôt properly understand. As scientist and writer Carl Sagan explains in The Demon Haunted World, A multitude of aspects of the natural world that were considered miraculous only a few generations ago are now thoroughly understood in terms of physics and chemistry. At least some of the mysteries of today will be comprehensively solved by our descendants. The fact that we cannot now produce a detailed understanding of, say, altered states of consciousness in terms of brain chemistry no more implies the existence of a ‚Äòspirit world‚Äô than a sunflower following the Sun in its course across the sky was evidence of a literal miracle before we knew about phototropism and plant hormones.5 The simpler explanation for a miracle is that there are principles of nature being exploited that we do not understand. This is Hume‚Äôs and Sagan‚Äôs point. 
    - Why are more complicated explanations less likely to be true? Let‚Äôs work it out mathematically. Take two competing explanations, each of which seem to equally explain a given phenomenon. If one of them requires the interaction of three variables and the other the interaction of thirty variables, all of which must have occurred to arrive at the stated conclusion, which of these is more likely to be in error? If each variable has a 99% chance of being correct, the first explanation is only 3% likely to be wrong. The second, more complex explanation, is about nine times as likely to be wrong, or 26%. The simpler explanation is more robust in the face of uncertainty.

    - Hard to trace in its origin, Hanlon‚Äôs Razor states that we should not attribute to malice that which is more easily explained by stupidity. In a complex world, using this model helps us avoid paranoia and ideology. By not generally assuming that bad results are the fault of a bad actor, we look for options instead of missing opportunities. This model reminds us that people do make mistakes. It demands that we ask if there is another reasonable explanation for the events that have occurred. The explanation most likely to be right is the one that contains the least amount of intent. 
    - Hanlon‚Äôs Razor 
    - The famous Linda problem, demonstrated by the psychologists Daniel Kahneman2 and Amos Tversky in a 1982 paper, is an illuminating example of how our minds work and why we need Hanlon‚Äôs Razor. It went like this: Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations. Which is more probable? Linda is a bank teller. Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement. The majority of respondents chose option 2. Why? The wording used to describe her suggests Linda is feminist. But Linda could only be a bank teller, or a feminist and a bank teller. So naturally the majority of students concluded she was both. They didn‚Äôt know anything about what she did, but because they were led to believe she had to be a feminist they couldn‚Äôt reject that option, even though the math of statistics makes it more likely that a single condition is true instead of multiple conditions. In other words, every feminist bank teller is a bank teller, but not every bank teller is a feminist. Thus, Kahneman and Tversky showed that students would, with enough vivid wording, assume it more likely that a liberal-leaning woman was both a feminist and a bank teller rather than simply a bank teller. They called it the ‚ÄúFallacy of Conjunction.‚Äù With this experiment, and a host of others, Kahneman and Tversky exposed a sort of tic in our mental machinery: we‚Äôre deeply affected by vivid, available evidence, to such a degree that we‚Äôre willing to make judgments that violate simple logic. We over-conclude based on the available information. We have no trouble packaging in unrelated factors if they happen to occur in proximity to what we already believe. 
    - What does this have to do with Hanlon‚Äôs Razor? The connection is this: When we see something we don‚Äôt like happen and which seems wrong, we assume it‚Äôs intentional. But it‚Äôs more likely that it‚Äôs completely unintentional. Assuming someone is doing wrong and doing it purposefully is like assuming Linda is more likely to be a bank teller and a feminist. Most people doing wrong are not bad people trying to be malicious.

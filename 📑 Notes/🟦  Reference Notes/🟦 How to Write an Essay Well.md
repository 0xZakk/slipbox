    - Style is a small part of writing well. Most of writing is thinking clearly.

 
    - By thinking critically, you navigate contradictions and connect the dots others aren’t seeing. You challenge the status quo. You contribute insights. Sometimes, you make people feel. 
    - That’s what it means to have something to say.

To write well is to think well.

 
    - There are many reasons to write. My favorite is leverage.

 
    - Writing is mostly thinking, which means becoming a better writer makes you a better thinker. 
    - Brilliant writers became brilliant by writing. 
    - Reading without note-taking is like exploring new territory without drawing a map.

    - Isaac Asimov wrote 500+ books in his lifetime.

Asimov wasn‚Äôt born writing 8 hours a day 7 days a week. He tore up pages, he got frustrated and he failed over and over and over again.

Here's how he did it:
    - Asimov wasn't just a science fiction writer. He wrote books on mythology, on Bible, on Shakespeare, on history, on science, & so on.

Asimov was able to write so much because he had a program of self-education in the process. He didn't stop learning after school.
    - To have good ideas, you need to consume good ideas too. Asimov read a lot. His interests were in 20 different directions.

When Asimov wrote a sci-fi novel, he frequently got stuck & couldn't get another word out.

He would switch to another one of his projects.
    - Asimov had 8-10 projects going on at a time. He would write an editorial, or an essay, or a nonfiction book.

By the time he grew tired of all those things, his mind was able to do its proper work & fill up again. Then he would return to the novel.
    - Asimov says that the ordinary writer always keeps revising an article, always chopping & changing, always trying different ways of expressing himself, never being entirely satisfied.

We reject our ideas before giving them a chance.
    - Asimov didn't edit as much. He kept publishing for the world to reject.

Asimov thought that writers are like artists trying to make a sketch. First, the artist needs to get the composition clear in his mind, the blocks of color, the balance, and the rest.
    - Once that's done, he can then worry about finer details.

He also said a writer can't sit around doubting the quality of his writing. Rather, he has to love his writing.
    - By the time a particular book was finished to be published, Asimov had multiple others lined up to write. So he didn't have much time to worry about how well it will be received or how much it will be sold. That brought calm & peace into his life.
    - A struggling writer friend asked Asimov, "where do you get your ideas?".

Asimov replied, "By thinking and thinking and thinking till I‚Äôm ready to kill myself. Did you ever think it was easy to get a good idea?"

    - Reading for Meaning (A Thread)

You were taught how to read aloud as a child, but you were probably never taught to read for meaning. 
    - Reading for meaning means reading things with purpose. 

It’s a useful reading hat to put on when you’re dealing with information dense writing, like textbooks, non-fiction books, blogs and academic papers. 
    - Reading for meaning means reading aggressively. 

You have questions and you’re looking for answers. 
    - Your purpose for reading could be to increase your understanding of some theme, getting clarity about a topic you’re confused about or answering a burning question. 
    - Finding your purpose for reading something is as easy as asking:

 “Why am I reading this? What do I want to learn?”

That question primes the mind to look for information which is relevant to your purpose. 
    - Here's my 7 step system for reading for meaning: https://t.co/sP0Es4szfe 
    - Notice how you don’t just read once over. Here we make 4 or 5 passes over the text in one reading. 
    - Remember that you don’t need to read a book from start to finish. 

You don’t need to read every word or every page. 

You don’t need to finish it all in one sitting and remember every single line.

    - You don’t start companies to get rich. You start them for reasons you don’t fully understand, and like a runner at the 18th mile, often question why you subjected yourself to such euphoric misery that is a startup. 
    - We’ll discuss two types of optimizations. One in terms of how to think about optimizing wealth, and another more tactical section. 
    - Dilution Matters. 
    - Cognitive Optimizations 
    - Founders treat equity as binary. Worthless until the video game ends. Suddenly you ring in the IPO and you’re a billionaire. For the most part this is the right way to think about it. 
    - However, you’re very likely to have an outcome in the middle. One where 1% of your company isn’t worth a billion dollars, but it’s worth a million. So when that VC offers you more money for more dilution, think twice! Don’t make this classic error. 
    - Penny Pinching. 
    - Overbearing frugality prevented me from spending any money, which creates inefficiencies. Spend like a king on speed, like a pauper on everything else. 
    - If you can, use your capital to move faster. 
    - Stop hacking airline miles and credit cards. 
    - Take all that energy and focus it on your startup. The ultimate ticket to First Class will come through making money, not flyertalk.com. 
    - Taxes Are Real 
    - Tactical Optimizations 
    - QSBS. If you have gross assets of $50 million or less, you can avoid federal (and occasionally state) tax 
    - Secondary 
    - Simplicity 
    - Here is the most important tip that nobody told me about: keep your finances simple. Assuming you have assets, confusion might be the largest cause of financial stress for you. 
    - Illiquidity 
    - Invest in things that quietly compound over the long term. 
    - I find it much easier to live my life with illiquid assets that aren’t valued every day. 
    - Portfolio Allocation. 
    - Do whatever will enable you to sleep best 
    - Get An Accountant.

    - Small plans at best yield small results, and big plans at worst beat small plans. 
    - Don’t be afraid of fear. Respect it, keep going, and move past it. 
    - Money does live on the other side of fear. But in a bigger sense opportunity lives on the other side of fear as well. 
    - “Our doubts are traitors, and make us lose the good we oft might win by fearing to attempt.” 
    - “In almost every game there are usually tried and true ways to win. And if you follow them, you may not win every time, but you will significantly increase your odds of winning most of the time.” 
    - The question is: How do you take luck out of the real real estate investing game? First, you learn to play the game. Second, you learn to win the game. 
    - Do it one way and get one result; do it another way and get a better result. I began to understand that for me there was clearly a good way of doing things. Along the way I also learned there was an even better way of doing things. However, my biggest epiphany came when I discovered that if I wanted the best, most predictable results possible, I couldn’t just put forth a good or even a great effort: I had to do things the best possible way. 
    - it took time for me to notice the pattern: The way I did things mattered. It mattered a lot. 
    - every success story worth exploring had three fundamental parts: what a person thought he or she could do, how that person did it, and what that person accomplished. That process—think, plan, produce—soon became the basis for my personal success formula: Big Goals powered by Big Models lead to Big Success. 
    - Big Goals—Big Models—Big Success.

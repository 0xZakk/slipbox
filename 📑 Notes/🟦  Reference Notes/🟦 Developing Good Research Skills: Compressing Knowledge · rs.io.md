    - I argued that interesting knowledge is knowledge which improves our ability to compress other knowledge ‚Äî interestingness signals something is an upgrade to our compressor module. 
    - Keep synthesizing what you learn into terser, clearer formulations. The goal of learning is not to memorize vast amounts of data. You need to do serious data compression, and filter out the noise. 
    - Tools for Compressing Knowledge 
    - Well, we can imagine a body of knowledge as a literal body, a corpse. We want to figure out the bones of that knowledge, the deep structure, and hang the rest of it ‚Äî the facts or ‚Äúflesh‚Äù ‚Äî on it. The trick to getting at such a skeleton, or building your own, is to seek models. 
    - Then, when new information comes in, one can hang it on an already built skeleton 
    - John suggests comparing and contrasting different phenomena as a means of compressing his own knowledge.

The effectiveness of both of these techniques ‚Äî connecting and contrasting ‚Äî may be a side-effect of the benefits of translating knowledge into new, novel forms. 
    - Pennington (1987) compared highly and poorly performing professional programmers. When trying to understand a program, high performers showed a ‚Äúcross-referencing strategy‚Äù characterized by systematic alterations between systematically studying the computer program, translating it to domain terms, and subsequently verifying domain terms back in program terms. In contrast, poorer performers exclusively focused on program terms or on domain terms without building connections between the two ‚Äúworlds.‚Äù Thus, it seems that connecting various domains and relating them to each other is crucial for arriving at a comprehensive understanding of the program and the underlying problem.

‚Äîfrom The Cambridge Handbook of Expertise 
    - If translation is a component of compressing knowledge, a cheap way to implement this would be to transform ideas into words, writing. 
    - Is there evidence to suggest that writing facilitates knowledge compression? K. Anders Ericsson‚Äôs landmark paper, ‚ÄúThe Role of Deliberate Practice in the Acquisition of Expert Performance‚Äù supports such a view:

The writing of expert authors on new topics is deliberate and constitutes an extended knowledge-transforming process, quite unlike the less effortful knowledge-telling approach used by novice writers (Scardemalia & Bereiter, 1991). In support of the importance of writing as an activity, Simonton (1988) found that eminent scientists produce a much larger number of publications than other scientists. It is clear from biographies of famous scientists that the time the individual spends thinking, mostly in the context of writing papers and books, appears to be the most relevant as well as demanding activity. 
    - We might suspect that writing is so effective because it forces knowledge to be retrieved and then restructured, sort of like taking iron ore, heating it, and then reworking it. Sounds a lot like compression, huh? 
    - What I‚Äôm suggesting then, all together, is that knowledge compression can be understood as a process through which one takes dormant knowledge and transforms it. 
    - The general, compressed principle, then is: to compress knowledge, recall that information (drag it into consciousness) and think about that information in some novel way.

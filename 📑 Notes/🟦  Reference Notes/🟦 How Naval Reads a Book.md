    - I no longer track books read or even care about books read. it's about understanding concepts.

There‚Äôs a lot of nonsense in books out there too so I don't read anymore to complete books. I read to satisfy my genuine intellectual curiosity and it can be anything. 
    - Naval reads for understanding and to fulfill genuine curiosity, not for completion, which often leads to shallow understanding, or for vanity metrics.

He doesn‚Äôt read one book at a time. He hops in and out of books in his virtual bookshelf, like you‚Äôd flip channels on a tv. What‚Äôs the difference between doing that and scrolling through your feed on social media? The only difference is probably how much you‚Äôd learn.

He doesn't read books cover to cover. he'll find a new idea, and ponder it for hours. 
    - It's also about retention. and we retain information better if we process it, have discussions, teach someone else. 
    - the truth is books aren't designed to promote learning. true learning happens with spaced repetition, tackling an idea from different, angles, discussing about to to gain new perspectives, connecting that idea to the knowledge base in our head. holistic learning. visceral learning. creating a memory palace or emotional connection to that information.

Your understanding deepens as you reread. but our society is leans towards the new, and the way we consume content has led us to be shallow. we consume constant streams of information, in hopes to feel informed. but what can we say we know off the top of the head? What do we know intuitively? What can we derive about the world from first principles? Did any of the content I read in the last week mean anything? Are current events distracting me from the questions that really matter? Do I even know myself?

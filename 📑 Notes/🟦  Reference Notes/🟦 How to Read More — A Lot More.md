    - I think there are three main barriers that hold people back from making this happen and I want to disassemble them right now so you can start reading way, way more 
    - The key to reading lots of book begins with stop thinking of it as some activity that you do. 
    - But forget money entirely when it comes to books. Reading is not a luxury. It’s not something you splurge on. It’s a necessity 
    - Human beings have been recording their knowledge in book form for more than 5,000 years. That means that whatever you’re working on right now, whatever problem you’re struggling with, is probably addressed in some book somewhere by someone a lot smarter than you. 
    - The purpose of reading is not just raw knowledge. It’s that it is part of the human experience. It helps you find meaning, understand yourself, and make your life better.

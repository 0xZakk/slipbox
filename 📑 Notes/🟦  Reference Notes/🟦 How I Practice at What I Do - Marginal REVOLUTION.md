    - A few of you were skeptical, but it is long since established that practice improves both your writing and your memory, so surely it can do much more than that for your thinking. 
    - Here is a partial list of some of my intellectual practice strategies: 
    - 1. I write every day. I also write to relax. 
    - 2. Much of my writing time is devoted to laying out points of view which are not my own. I recommend this for most of you. 
    - 3. I do serious reading every day. 
    - 4. After a talk, Q&A session, podcast ‚Äî whatever ‚Äî I review what I thought were my weaker answers or interventions and think about how I could improve them. I rehearse in my mind what I should have said. 
    - 5. I spent an enormous amount of time and energy trying to crack cultural codes. I view this as a comparative advantage, and one which few other people in my fields are trying to replicate. For one thing, it makes me useful in a wide variety of situations where I have little background knowledge. This also helps me invest in skills which will age relatively well, as I age. For me, this is perhaps the most importantly novel item on this list. 
    - 6. I listen often to highly complex music, partly because I enjoy it but also in the (silly?) hope that it will forestall mental laziness. 
    - 7. I have regular interactions with very smart people who will challenge me and be very willing to disagree, including ‚ÄúGMU lunch.‚Äù 
    - 8. Every day I ask myself ‚Äúwhat did I learn today?‚Äù, a question I picked up from Amihai Glazer. I feel bad if I don‚Äôt have a clear answer, while recognizing the days without a clear answer are often the days where I am learning the most (at least in the equilibrium where I am asking myself this question). 
    - 9. One factor behind my choice of friends is what kind of approbational sway they will exercise over me. You should want to hang around people who are good influences, including on your mental abilities. Peer effects really are quite strong. 
    - 10. I watch very little television. And no drugs and no alcohol should go without saying. 
    - 11. In addition to being a ‚Äúproduct‚Äù in its own right, I also consider doing Conversations with Tyler ‚Äî with many of the very smartest people out there ‚Äî to be a form of practice. It is a practice for speed, accuracy in understanding written writings, and the ability to crack the cultural codes of my guests. 
    - 12. I teach ‚Äî a big one. 
    - Here are a few things I don‚Äôt do: 
    - Taking notes is a favorite with some people I know, though my penmanship and coordination and also typing are too problematic for that. 
    - I also don‚Äôt review video or recordings of myself, for fear that will make me too self-conscious. For many people that is probably a good idea, however. 
    - I don‚Äôt spend time trying to improve my memory, which is either very bad or very good, depending on the kind of problem facing me. 
    - I‚Äôve never practiced trying to type on a small screen 
    - I‚Äôll close by repeating the end of my previous post:

Recently, one of my favorite questions to bug people with has been ‚ÄúWhat is it you do to train that is comparable to a pianist practicing scales?‚Äù If you don‚Äôt know the answer to that one, maybe you are doing something wrong or not doing enough. Or maybe you are (optimally?) not very ambitious? 
    - Better training has brought big improvements to the quality of athletics and also chess, and many of those advances are quite recent ‚Äî when is the intellectual world going to follow suit? When are you going to follow suit?

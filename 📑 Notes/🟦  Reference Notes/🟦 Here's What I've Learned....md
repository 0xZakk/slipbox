    - Here's what I've learned about launching online products.

1. Give tons of free stuff away.

The Internet rewards people who teach. Share your best ideas for free, and you will attract an audience of like-minded people. Build an audience before you launch your first product. 
    - 2. Build a niche audience.

Large audiences are sexy, niche audiences are profitable. Unique creators benefit from a lack of competition and loyal audiences. Build knowledge, gain a unique perspective, and share it with the world.

    - 3. Listen to your audience.

Write about what you're interested in. Then, double-down on what your audience wants to learn about. Listen for phrases they repeat and write them down. Then, once it's time to write your sales copy, you can speak to your customer directly. 
    - 4. Start creating now.

Start before you're ready. Some people spend their whole lives waiting for the sound of a starting gun that never goes off. Don‚Äôt wait. The thing you‚Äôve been waiting for is‚Ä¶ your own permission.

    - 5. Remember the compounding graph.

Audience building is a game of compounding. You start slowly, but once you gain momentum, you can hit escape velocity. The beginning of any compounding curve is a flat line. Keep publishing, listen to your audience, and aim to improve. https://t.co/TNEspJEgbb 
    - 6) Have a vision

Your product should come from the heart. Solving your own problems is the best way to do that. Here's a trick: Find something that bothers you, and if you can find ten people who have the same problem, build a solution. Then, write about your creation process. 
    - 7) Write a manifesto. 

It's time to craft your story. Write a short (250 word) manifesto about your product. It should have three parts. First, outline the problem. Second, share your solution to the problem. Third, talk about the specifics of your solution.

Here's an example. https://t.co/02GLAB1Try 
    - 8) Build buzz before your first product launch. 

Remember the 3-2-1 strategy. Three months before you launch your first product, publish your manifesto. Two months before, share a preview. One month before launch, open your product for pre-sale to generate word-of-mouth buzz. 
    - 9) Show people your product.

When you buy a shirt, you want to feel it. You want to touch the nylon and examine the cotton. Launching an online product is no different. People want to see your product before they buy it.

Here are some ways to do that, written by @JasonFried. https://t.co/t3lVculs2Z 
    - 10) Share your hit singles.

Before a new album comes out, musicians freely share the best songs. The added hype is worth more than the allure of secrecy. Your product should have a hit single too. Share your best nuggets of insight in free online articles, videos, and podcasts.

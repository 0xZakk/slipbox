    - I am just a guy from Netanya, a small town on the Mediterranean. I am constantly amazed by the fact that the smartest people on earth would give me the time of day. I am constantly amazed — truly, amazed — by the internet’s ability to deliver ideas to the exact people who would find them most compelling.
    - The ability to create perfect matches is an obvious feature of the web. But I suspect most people still don’t grasp the implications of this ability.
    - That’s what my next book is about. The internet enables each of us to earn more than ever before by matching us with the exact people — fans, customers, employers — who value our unique combination of skills and characteristics. It enables each of us to become a superstar. But it also exposes us to anxieties that were previously reserved for a select few.
    - My upcoming book, Winner Takes Most, explores the prosperity and anxiety that result from this process, and how they will affect a growing number of professions — from programmers and teachers to doctors and fitness instructors.
    - I see us moving into a world of winner takes most. The original “Creative Class”, as defined by Richard Florida, was a large number of people and most of them worked for large companies and had a stable salary.

What I am talking about is the splitting of this original Creative Class into another layer at the top which includes maybe 10-15% of people who are now released from those corporate jobs and also released from the constraints of geography. They no longer compete for jobs or projects just in their own city but they can compete for jobs all over the world and someone who values them for their specific expertise is going to pay them ten times more than an employer in the same city because that’s how optimal matching works.
    - Another interesting point is that the winners are not exactly winners. The future of work is not a game that you simply win and then rest on your laurels. We’re all becoming movie stars. We have the potential to make 100X more money than before because of the internet. But all the anxieties of being a star come with that as well.
    - We hit a home run today but we have no idea what we’ll do tomorrow. There is a certain percentage of people every year who are going to make more money than ever before, but whoever belongs to that little pool of people is going to change constantly. It’s going to be a very cruel and anxiety-ridden world even for the most successful people.

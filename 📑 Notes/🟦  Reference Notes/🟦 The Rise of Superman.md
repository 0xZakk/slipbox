    - The edge is the one place these ghosts can‚Äôt follow. 
    - ‚ÄúMost people live in a very restricted circle of their potential being. They make use of a very small portion of their possible consciousness, and of their soul‚Äôs resources in general, much like a man who, out of his whole organism, should get into a habit of using and moving only his little finger.‚Äù 
    - The trail of Heim to James to Cannon went from psychology into physiology. It was a trail of mechanism: mindset impacts emotion, which alters biology, which increases performance. Thus, it seemed, by tinkering with mindset‚Äîusing everything from physical to psychological to pharmacological interventions‚Äîone could significantly enhance performance. 
    - ‚Äúsecond wind.‚Äù [F]atigue gets worse up to a certain critical point, when gradually or suddenly it passes away, and we are fresher than before. We have evidently tapped a level of new energy, masked until then by the fatigue-obstacle usually obeyed. There may be layer after layer of this experience. A third and a fourth ‚Äúwind‚Äù may supervene. Mental activity shows the phenomenon as well as physical, and in exceptional cases we may find, beyond the very extremity of fatigue-distress, amounts of ease and power that we never dreamed ourselves to own, sources of strength habitually not taxed at all, because habitually we never push through the obstruction, never pass those early critical points. 
    - ‚ÄúDuring a peak experience,‚Äù Maslow explained, ‚Äúthe individual experiences an expansion of self, a sense of unity, and meaningfulness in life. The experience lingers in one‚Äôs consciousness and gives a sense of purpose, integration, self-determination and empathy.‚Äù 
    - The peak experience is felt as a self-validating, self-justifying moment.‚Ä¶ It is felt to be a highly valuable‚Äîeven uniquely valuable‚Äîexperience, so great an experience sometimes that even to attempt to justify it takes away from its dignity and worth. As a matter of fact, so many people find this so great and high an experience that it justifies not only itself, but even living itself. Peak experiences can make life worthwhile by their occasional occurrence. They give meaning to life itself. They prove it to be worthwhile. To say this in a negative way, I would guess that peak experiences help to prevent suicide. 
    - ‚Äúbeing so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter. The ego falls away. Time flies. Every action, movement and thought follows inevitably from the previous one, like playing jazz. Your whole being is involved, and you‚Äôre using your skills to the utmost.‚Äù 
    - Here‚Äôs his list: Clear goals: Expectations and rules are discernible and goals are attainable and align appropriately with one‚Äôs skill set and abilities. 
    - Moreover, the challenge level and skill level should both be high. Concentration: A high degree of concentration on a limited field of attention. A loss of the feeling of self-consciousness: The merging of action and awareness. Distorted sense of time: One‚Äôs subjective experience of time is altered. Direct and immediate feedback: Successes and failures are apparent, so behavior can be adjusted as needed. Balance between ability level and challenge: The activity is neither too easy nor too difficult. A sense of personal control over the situation. The activity is intrinsically rewarding, so action is effortlessness. A lack of awareness of bodily needs. Absorption: narrowing of awareness down to the activity itself. 
    - Csikszentmihalyi uses the terms microflow and macroflow to explain these variations. In microflow, only a few of his categories are fulfilled‚Äîsay clear goals, concentration, and absorption, or what would happen if Laird Hamilton paddled out for an afternoon of mellow Malibu surf. Macroflow, on the other hand, is what occurs when all of Csikszentmihalyi‚Äôs conditions arrive at once‚Äîit‚Äôs the full Teahupoo.

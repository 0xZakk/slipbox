    - Building a Twitter audience is hard because existing social connections don’t help much. Unlike Facebook, it’s not built around family. Unlike LinkedIn, it’s not built around professional relationships.

The platform doesn’t help you grow your audience either. It rewards people who already have big audiences, so people without a lot of followers feel invisible. 
    - If you want to grow your following, I have three suggestions for you: 
    - Reply to big accounts: Grow your following by replying to popular tweets. Find new tweets written by an account with a big following and add an intelligent reply. This works because Twitter’s algorithm ranks replies by engagement (the number of likes and comments). By adding insightful replies, you’ll surf the wave of people with big audiences. 
    - More periods, fewer commas: How your writing will improve: First, short sentences. Short sentences are clear. Like this. Simple. Got it? Nice. But if you remove commas, your writing will also have fewer long, windy, rambling, verbose, and complicated sentences like this one. 
    - Write tweetstorms: Improve your writing with tweetstorms, which allow you to communicate in more depth than a single tweet can provide. As you smash the tweet button, you’ll get instant feedback on the quality of your writing and the interestingness of your ideas. Communicate expertise. Explain a confusing topic in a simple way. Take a mundane idea and make it interesting. Tell the story of something famous that everybody knows about. If you can, connect your tweetstorm to what’s happening in the news cycle. 
    - I advocate these strategies because they will grow your audience while also making Twitter better for everybody. Twitter needs less junk and more thoughtful ideas. Less anger, more beauty. 
    - Share your epiphanies. Add a bolt of energy by replying to big accounts and sharing your expertise in tweetstorms. Boost your signal-to-noise ratio. Inspire your audience. Light up their day with jokes, spark their curiosity with ideas, or awaken their mind with hard-won knowledge.

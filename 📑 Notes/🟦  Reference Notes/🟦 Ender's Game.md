# Ender's Game

## Summary:

A boy named Ender is selected by the military to train at an elite space school where children are divided into platoons and pitched against each other in simulated war games. 

Ender quickly distinguishes himself and his platoon, rapidly rising through the ranks at his school. He is eventually transferred to a battle station on the outer edge of the solar system, where he participates in an even higher-stakes game: simulated attacks on a series of alien colonies.

He triumphs over these simulated aliens only to discover that they weren't simulated at all.

- **Type:** #[[ðŸŸª Personal Note]] | #Sovereignty
- How can we make it easier for communities to control their own destinies?
- The world is rapidly changing and with it many of the power structures (or even what it means to have power). The Sovereign Individual (book) predicted much of the upheaval that weâ€™re experiencing today as the authors conceptualized a world where sovereignty was endowed to the individual, not the nation state. While the authors insights are very prescient, they seem to have missed one very simple truth about the history of humans: at no point have we ever survived as individuals. In fact, quite the opposite. 
- While it may be increasingly possible to establish individual sovereignty, our brains are simply not wired that way. Using the authors method of looking at incentives, it is far more likely that sovereignty will shift to the community, not the individual. Individuals will have a choice of joining what ever sovereign community (or possibly communities) they wish. But the question will be what community should I join, not how can I go alone.
- Assuming a shift from the nation state level to a tribal level, what can we build to empower these communities to be the masters of their own fate?
- I donâ€™t think we can make assumptions over how communities will form. Will they be formed geographically? Some of them. But some of them may form digitally or virtually. Some may form along a shared set of values while others may form temporarily in the pursuit of single goal.
- Some ideas for things that communities will likely need:
- Infrastructure:
    - Housing and land titles
    - Membership
    - Banking and Finance
    - Identity management
    - Rule and Regulation management and amendment
- Community Examples:
- **WealthSquad** is a community that exists around community leader @CJ_Johnson17th to build generational wealth. The community is dedicated to learning from each other, giving each other advice and tips, and helping everyone in the community achieve new levels of wealth. At the moment, the community is organized on Twitter and Discord, both of which have recently limited access or outright banned communities. Replacing something like Twitter and/or Discord would be a wise step. Just as someone might tweet to direct their audience to a newsletter that they own, @CJ_Johnson17th could tweet to direct the Wealth Squad community to a set of open source or custom built tools. This would preserve their community, but there are further steps that @CJ_Johnson17th and Wealth Squad could take to make their community thrive. Why not build a custom Wealth Squad bank, leveraging APIs from [Synapse Fi](https://synapsefi.com/) (banking, savings, checking, etc), [Stripe Issuing](https://stripe.com/issuing) (credit cards), and [Polygon.io](http://Polygon.io) or [Alpaca](https://alpaca.markets/) (for trading stocks, currencies, and crypto).
- **Universities** can have avid alumni and student communities that dedicate a lot of time, money, and energy into the identity of their alma matter. Why not build a set of tools that Universities could use to leverage the power of these communities. A simple example is using banking and finance. What if someone took out a student loan directly with the University they wanted to attend? The University could offer a low interest rate and flexible repayment, while harnessing the financial power that comes with a loan. They could also offer tribal banking (i.e. Eagles Banking) with direct-from-account donations to the endowment.
- A few others:
    - Fraternities and Sororities

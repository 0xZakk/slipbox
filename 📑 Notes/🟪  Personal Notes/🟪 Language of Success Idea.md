- **Type:** #[[🟪 Personal Note]] | #[[Success]]
- It’s weird that we say things “I want to be successful” or “I am successful,” as if success is a permanent state and not an event with a long tail
- I think the same might be true for happiness: I want to be happy
- It’s a shortcut in the way we think, but it has a pretty big downside: it disregards the inevitability of life happening
- When you think about it, that seems kind of silly
- You think, “I want to be happy” as if there’s this place you can get to where nothing that would ever make you unhappy could possibly happen?
- Same with success: Being successful is just having had a successful event and then living in the tail of it. You have a windfall earnings event and you don’t blow it all
- I think psychologically, we want to rest and Be, but physiologically, we want to move on to the next thing

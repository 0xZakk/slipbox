The fundamental problem that blockchains solve is the **placement of trust**.

If you ran a business, which customer would you sell to: someone who came in and offered to buy a product with a $10 bill or someone who offered you a piece of paper with IOU written on it? You would sell to the person offering you $10. The reason is trust. When someone buys a product using dollars, you trust the US Government to validate that bill and to maintain it's value. You don't trust someone you don't know.

The implication is that we trust institutions and do not trust each other.

However, we're at an inflection point in history where trust for institutions is deteriorating. We trusted banks for a long time - they managed our money and in return we received dividends and other benefits. They were insured and audited by the US Government. Despite all of this assurance, the financial crisis of 2008 showed that institutions can still fail. They can even be corrupt.

Blockchains solves this problem with decentralization.

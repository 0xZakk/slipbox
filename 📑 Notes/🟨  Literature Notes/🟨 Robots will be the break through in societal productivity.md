- Given the incredible gains in technology, Western society should be a lot more productive than it is. See [[ðŸŸ¨ Western Society should be a lot more productive]]
- While there are theories for why ([[ðŸŸ¨ Theories for why modern society isn't more productive]]), perhaps the issue is in how we interface with these increases in productivity
- Where something can be done completely on a computer, productivity is 100x; where something has to translate from digital to analog, productivity is still relatively low. So maybe humans implementing digital products is the bottleneck.
- If that is the case, then robots will be what unleashes the huge advances in productivity

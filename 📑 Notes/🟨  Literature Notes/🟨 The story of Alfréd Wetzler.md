Alfréd Wetzler escaped from Auschwitz and smuggled out information on the camp and it's use that proved what the Nazis were doing there.

He escaped by hiding in a pile of wood that he and some of the other inmates and soaked in tobacco and gasoline, so the guard dogs wouldn't be able to smell him. He hid in the wood pile for four nights. Then, he put on a stolen suit and made the 80 mile journey to the Polish boarder with Slovakia.

He carried with him a report on how the death camp working, a ground plan, details of he gas chambers, and a label from a gas canister. By doing so, he was able to save about 120,000 Hungarian Jews.

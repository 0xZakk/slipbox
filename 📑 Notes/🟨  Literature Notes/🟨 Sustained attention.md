- Sustained attention is the kind of attention we use when we focus on one task for a long period of time. It is necessary to learn new things and to finish large projects.
- The average duration for which people can hold sustained attention has decreased significantly in recent years, likely due to the constant interruptions we face and short-attention spanned media we consume.
- That said, it is possible to train our sustained attention to last longer. We can do this by focusing on a single task at a time (not multitasking), removing distractions, and separating different kinds of tasks.
- Additionally, we can create workflows and operate within systems that we set up that make prolonged sustained attention easier for us.

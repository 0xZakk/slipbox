- **Notes:**
    - While GraphQL isn't opinionated about how you implement the spec, it does provide the following design principles:
    - **Hierarchical:** Fields can be nested inside of other fields. The structure of the query also makes an implicit request about the structure of the response.
    - **Product Centric:** The language and runtime should support the client and it's data needs.
    - **Strong Typing:** A GraphQL server must also adhere to the GraphQL type system. Each data point in the schema must have specific type definitions.
    - **Client-specified Queries:** The server should give the client all the capabilities it needs.
    - **Introspective:** The client should be able to query the server's type system using GraphQL.

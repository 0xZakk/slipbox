- As a young Marine, Jim Mattis learned the fundamentals of leaderships, summed up in the three Cs:
    - Competence
    - Caring
    - Conviction
- According to Mattis, an effective leader should train themselves in all of these.
- Leadership is fundamentally about reaching the soul of your subordinates and instilling in them a sense of purpose that will fuel them to overcome the challenges in front of them.
- **1. Competence**
- The first of the Three Cs of Leadership is Competence.
- As a leader, your goal should be to master every role as you advance up the ladder. This involves evaluating your strengths and weaknesses in each position and making a concerted effort to improve where you are weak.
- Mattis gives examples of where and how to improve yourself. For instance, if you are a Marine and you are running three miles in eighteen minutes, work out more to try and improve your speed. However, it's not just about the physical aspect of being a Marine that you need to improve. If you are not a good listener, then make a disciplined and concerted effort to improve your active listening.
- Regardless of where you are in your career, you should always focus on the basics. Many of the detrimental mistakes that people make, regardless of their level in the organization, come back to the fundamentals
- **2. Caring**
- The second of the Three Cs of Leadership is Caring.
- It's really important that your subordinates know that you care about them. Not only because this will bring out the best in them, but because having that trust and reassurance will make it easier for you to manage and coach them.
- To make this point, Mattis references the Teddy Roosevelt quote that says people don't care about how much you know if they don't know how much you care.
- Caring is an important trait of leadership because it (1) facilitates better, more honest relationships with your subordinates and (2) orients you in how you should treat your subordinates. If you subordinates know that you care about them, then you can be honest with them when they disappoint you; if you care about them, you can be honest in a way that doesn't demoralize them.
- As a leader, you need to maintain a personal and social distance between you and your subordinates. There is a line there that you should never cross, but effective leadership requires getting as close to that line as possible.
- A prerequisite to effective leadership like this is getting to know your subordinates as individuals. Do you know what their specific goals and aspirations are? Who do they want to become? If you know these things and you put the effort in helping them improve and achieve their dreams then you're likely to win them over for good.
- **3. Conviction**
- The third of the Three Cs of Leadership is Conviction
- Conviction is more important and more difficult than courage.
- To Mattis, conviction is about having a set of values and having the discipline to stick to those values when necessary and change those values when necessary.
- Your subordinates will quickly be able to sniff out what you will and wont stand for. Conviction is a matter of stating your rules and sticking to them.
- You need to have conviction but you can't let that conviction get in the way of your compassion for your subordinates, nor your own personal humility.
- As an officer, the only battle you need to win the battle for the hearts of your troops. Once you've won them over, they will win the fight. As a leader, your first and primary goal is to win over the people working for you. If you win them over, then they will go off and accomplish what ever goal you're trying to achieve.

One [[ðŸŸ¨ Two formal strategies of habit formation | formal strategy]] of habit formation is scheduling. Under this strategy, you pick a time (and likely a cadence) to perform a habit and try not to miss a session.

An example of a scheduled habit is to go to the gym on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays.

The advantage of this system is that you have to, by nature of it being scheduled, find a time to perform or practice the habit. However, the system can be brittle and inflexible in the context of the rest of your life. What do you do if a really important client wants to meet with you on Wednesday, when you would otherwise go to the gym?

# ðŸŸ¨ The Hudson Bay Start

Fur traders in British Columbia developed something called The Hudson Bay Start, which they would do before setting out on a long fur trapping expedition.

After getting all their supplies and finishing their preparations for a trip, they would set out from Hudson Bay. However, they would only travel a few miles out of town before setting up camp for the night. Why?

They wanted to discover what they had forgotten to bring while they were less than an hour's hike back into town.

The lesson is this: find low-stakes way to test your process.

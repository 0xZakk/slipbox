__"It is not so important who you are, but what you do. Doing the work required and doing it in a smart way leads, somehow unsurprisingly, to success."__ -- Sonke Ahrens, *How to Take Smart Notes*

We can't do much to change our self-discipline and self-control. Whether we can change them at all is up for debate and, if we can, we can only improve these things about ourselves by a little bit.

However, we have complete control over what we do and where and how we do it. So, we can set up a system wherein success is inevitable.

It is not having willpower that will lead to success, but not having to use willpower.

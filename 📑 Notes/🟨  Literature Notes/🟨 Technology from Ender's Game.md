# üü® Technology from Ender's Game

Status: [[üìù To Process]] - need to finish the last section

Many of the technologies described by Orson Scott Card in Ender's game ended up becoming real. Below are a list of examples

##  Monitor

When Ender is a young boy attending "normal" school on Earth, a monitor is attached to the base of his spine. It is used by the military to record everything that Ender senses (sees, smells, etc), even subconsciously.

While this doesn't exist yet, this is the long-term aim of Neuralink, a company and technology developed by Elon Musk. The Neuralink is a small, implanted device that connects to the brain and reads electrical signals. It then sends those signals wirelessly to external hardware (like an iPhone) where they can be read and processed.

In the mid-term, the device is intended as a shunt for people with debilitative  spinal injuries. Multiple Neuralinks could be implanted to read signals from the patient's brain. These electrical signals would then be transmitted to a secondary device that would "reproduce" these signals below the injury and make motor control possible again.

Long-term, the device is intended to be a brain-computer interface. Computers can process information very quickly, so the bottle neck in leveraging computers is human interaction speeds.

## Desks

Everyone in Ender's Game owns something called a Desk, a hybrid between a laptop and a tablet-like device. In school, the children use these to take notes and do their assignments. At the battle school, students use them for their school work, to communicate with each other, and to play games that are meant to train them.

These tablet-laptop devices do already exist and they are widely used in schools and for communication. The interesting piece of this that hasn't really come true is how to use the devices that everyone has in their pockets to effectively train people in new skills at a large scale. People are working on this, but I don't think anyone has really nailed it. I think there's also a lot more potential for this to work really well with the technology that we have. By that I mean, the smart phone and affordable VR headsets.

Just about everyone has a smart phone in their pockets, something that could be used for really widespread, high quality, video-game like education. Like someone crack the code on teaching math with a video game. How can you use these devices to create an infinite number of high quality feedback loops? Khan Academy is close - I think they're on to the right idea. I see two problems with Khan Academy: there's a narrow set of problems and solutions and it's not addictive the way a video game is (you get a list of problems and yous solve them).

The same could be true for Virtual Reality. If you get a job at Starbucks, you should get a VR headset where you just run through simulation after simulation. I bet if you had someone do that for 1-3 weeks, they would be just an outstanding barista. Another example is sales: put someone in simulation after simulation with automated feedback from the computer and qualitative feedback from the sales team or a trainer. In a few weeks they'd be excellent at it.

[[Jim Mattis]] talks a little bit about this in [[üü¶ Call Sign Chaos]] where he hires Hollywood set designers to set up a training environment in a warehouse with a bunch of actors and has squads drill routines. He says in his book that he wants his solders to "die" multiple times in this simulation before they get shipped to Iraq.

## Digital Tables

There's a scene in Ender's Game where his family is sitting down in the living room eating their breakfast and Ender's dad is reading the news on the living room table. The table is an interactive digital surface that acts like a computer.

Microsoft attempted to do something like this, but the product didn't last long. I don't know how widely appealing something like this would be and VR/AR might negate the need for it in a lot of ways. Another big drawback of this is the ergonomics of it: you look straight down at your table instead of being able to easily adjust your point of focus.

## Locke and Demosthenes

Later in the book, while Ender is at battle school, his siblings, Peter and Valentine, take up pseudonyms and start to write anonymously on the nets. They publish something every day and soon build up a big following of people who listen to their ideas. With these audiences, they're able to sway politics.

The nets sounds like a global, distributed version of Reddit. It sounds a lot like the modern internet mixed with AOL. For instance, you need credits in order to access the nets, so Peter and Valentine write in exchange for credits. In many ways, this sounds like QAnon and related misinformation phenomena.

There are also multiple nets that someone could write to. The internet is currently fractured into communities and social networks, but it all happens on the same macro-network. A distributed solution with competing nets could look something like an Ethereum-based internet.

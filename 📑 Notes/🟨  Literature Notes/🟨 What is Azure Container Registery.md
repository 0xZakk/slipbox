- Azure Container Registry (ACR) is a service provided by Azure to make working with container images easier.
- It is similar to Docker Hub, in that it works by creating a repository of one or more Docker images for each registry. You can keep registries of images private or make them public.
- You can also integrate ACR registries with other Azure services. This is helpful for doing things like redeploying a web application whenever an image is rebuilt.

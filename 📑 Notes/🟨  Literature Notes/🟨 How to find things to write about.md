- Good writing topics will come from one of the following three buckets:
- **Things you know**
    - Take a topic that you are interested in and know some things about and share your knowledge.
    - You don't have to be an expert on the topic, just able to add something to the conversation.
    - One way to brainstorm topics in this bucket is to think about questions you get asked regularly. Write articles that answer those questions.
- **Things you're excited about**
    - These are things that get you excited.
    - If you are excited about something, then share what it is and why on your personal site. Hype is contagious. 
- **Things you believe**
    - This category of posts are things that you believe. You have to formulate your opinion and take a stance in your article.
    - With posts about things you believe, you are likely to piss people off.
    - People tend to play it safe with the content that they post online. Your goal should be to write about something interesting

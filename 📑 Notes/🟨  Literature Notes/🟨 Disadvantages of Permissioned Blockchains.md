- Permissioned blockchains are not without their disadvantages.  There are two that are important to consider: Security and Control.
- **Security:**
    - Fully public and fully private blockchains tend to offer better security because of how nodes/participants achieve consensus. In permissioned blockchains, it can be easier for a section of the network to work together to modify the network (either the rules or the ledger).
    - This potential security vulnerability can be resolved by establishing permissions and rules so that it's difficult for bad actors to merge together
- **Control and Censorship:**
    - Control is a defining feature of permissioned blockchain, but it also acts as a form of censorship. The regulations of the blockchain can restrict transactions and control them from happening.

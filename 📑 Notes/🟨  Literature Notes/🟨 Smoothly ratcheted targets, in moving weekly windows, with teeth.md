Andy Matuschak's solution to [[ðŸŸ¨Three Problems with Goals and Goal-setting | the common problems with standard goal setting]] is to create, what he calls, smoothly ratcheted targets, in moving windows, with teeth.

There are three parts to this:

## [[ðŸŸ¨ Smoothly ratcheting targets for habit formation | Smoothly ratcheted targets:]]

When a habit starts to feel accomplished easily, you want to increase the difficulty (i.e. ratchet up your target). 

## [[ðŸŸ¨ Using a moving weekly window to form habits | Moving Windows]]

Rather than attempt a brittle goal, like `"Do <X> <N> times per week"`, implement goals and practice in a moving weekly window (`"Do <X> <N> times in the last 7 days."`).

## Teeth

You need skin in the game for a new habit to really stick. Andy does this by losing a small amount of money if he misses his goal.

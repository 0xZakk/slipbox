# ðŸŸ¨ Four Types of Notes in a Slipbox

There are four types of notes that we need to concern ourselves with when it comes to working with a Slipbox:
- **Fleeting Notes** are reminders of information or ideas, but not the ideas themselves. One example of a fleeting note is the note you make when you're walking around and an idea comes to your. You write it down so you don't forget it. But you have to return to the note and turn it into a permanent note later in order for it to be valuable. Another example is marginalia or notes you make in a book. These are just reminders of an idea or a thought or a recording of an idea that you want to use later. These notes are completely useless on their own. They only become useful if you go back and turn them into permanent notes later. See also [[ðŸŸ¨ What is the purpose of fleeting notes?]]
- **Literature Notes** is a summary of a point made in a reference. It is short and written in your own words. See also [[ðŸŸ¨ What is the purpose of literature notes?]]
- **Permanent Notes** is a note that can become part of a written project or stand alone as a written project. The entire goal of the Slipbox is that you can sit down and organize a few permanent notes together into an outline that you can edit for cohesion into a rough draft. Permanent notes are what make this possible. See also [[ðŸŸ¨ What is the purpose of permanent notes?]]
- **Project Notes** are notes that are related to a single project. These are like fleeting notes that are for a single, specific project. Things like comments and feedback on a draft and reminders are examples of project notes. You should just delete these when the project is finished.

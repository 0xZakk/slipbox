# ðŸŸ¨ Building and running a Go program

There are two tools you need to build and run a Go program. Because Go is a compiled language, you have to build it into a binary in order to distribute it. The command to build a Go program into a binary is `go build`. You can still run a Go program in development without having to build it though. The command for that is `go run`.

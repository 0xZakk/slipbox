- In Go, if you declare a variable but do not assign it a value, then it will be assigned the zero value for the variable's type. Every type in Go has a built-in zero value. So if you declare a variable of type string without assigning it a value, it will have an empty string as its value as an empty string is the zero value for string types. For numbers, the empty value is 0.

- Once you have the Fabric test network installed ([[ðŸŸ¨ Installing Hyperledger Fabric]]), you can bring up the network and start interacting with it.
- The [hyperledger/fabric-samples](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples) repository includes a script for starting and stopping the test network called `network.sh`, which you can find in the `test-network` directory.
- To print the help text, run `./network.sh -h`
- To start the test network, run `./network.sh up`
- To stop the network and remove any containers from the network, run `./network.sh down`

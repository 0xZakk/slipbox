# ðŸŸ¨ Discovering ideas and writing topics with the Slipbox

Most writing advice has you start off by brainstorming an idea, then researching the idea and writing your paper from there. With the Slipbox and a good collection of permanent notes, we don't have to rely on our brains to come up with novel ideas, something they're not particularly good at.

Instead, when we want to come up with a new topic to write about, we just look at the topography of our Slipbox and see where clusters of notes are starting to form. These clusters of notes will be areas where we have spent a lot of time, consciously or unconsciously, developing your ideas.

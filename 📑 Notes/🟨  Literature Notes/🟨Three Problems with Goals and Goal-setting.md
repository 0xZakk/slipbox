Shane Parish outlines a few problems faced by goals and goal-setting.

First, goals are finite. Typically goal setting requires not just the *what* to achieve but the *when* to achieve it by. This is why someone can set a goal to lose a bunch of weight and then quickly gain it all back (i.e. revert).

Second, achieving a goal often involves things outside of our control. If your goal is to run a marathon, what happens when you get injured? Often the things outside of our control are things we can (and should) plan for. But goal-setting doesn't account for this.

Third, goals require a lot of constant *and* variable cognitive effort to achieve. You have to constantly keep the goal in mind (i.e. if your goal is to save money, you have to remember that every time you go to make any purchase). You also have to review and adjust the goal when presented with novel situations (if your goal is to run a marathon, you have to adjust your plan if you get sick, if you go on vacation, if your shoes wear through, etc).

For all of history, it has been the role of men to provide for their families and their communities. Traditionally, that meant hunting and providing food or, more recently, providing financially.

It is still the responsibility of men to provide and a Sovereign Man accepts that responsibility. While modernity hasn't changed that core of that responsibility, it has shifted some. Now a man isn't only responsible for providing financially and he isn't solely responsible. He is primarily responsible for providing for his family with the help of his wife. And a Sovereign Man provides more than just financially. He provides Mentally, Emotionally, and Spiritually too

**How to Provide Financially**

The overwhelming majority of men still provide financially for their families, but a growing number of men are passing off this responsibility to their wives or their government, through well-fare programs. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of men to provide financially for their families and communities. Men who avoid this responsibility are degrading themselves and giving away their Sovereignty. This is a case of [[ðŸŸ¨ Natural Man | the Natural Man]] trying to get something for nothing.

There's nothing more satisfying to a man -- any man -- than coming home at the end of a long day of work knowing your family is benefiting from the results of your labor.

**How to Provide Mentally**

A man must also learn to provide mentally for himself and his family. That means developing mental fortitude and resilience so that he can lead in good times and in bad times.

How will you plan for and overcome the events you and your family are likely to experience? If you don't, you could find yourself in ruin.

**How to Provide Emotionally**

Most men have been told that they don't or shouldn't feel emotions. That's insane and the result is that these men are at the mercy of their emotions. Without the tools necessary to understand your emotions --how you feel and what it means -- you end up controlled by your feelings, instead of the other way around.

Instead, you should see emotional intelligence as a cornerstone of masculinity. If you can understand why you feel the way you do, then you have the power to do something about it.

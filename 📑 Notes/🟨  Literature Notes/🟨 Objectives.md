Once you have a [[ðŸŸ¨ Vision]], you have to do something about it. Visualization is powerful, but it's not enough to create action. You need to set objectives for that.

If your vision is what victory looks like in the battle for your Sovereignty, your objectives are how you'll know if you're working towards victory or not.

Your objectives will fall into one of [[ðŸŸ¨ The Four Quadrants]].

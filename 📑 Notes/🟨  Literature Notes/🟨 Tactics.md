The thing that's often missing from goal setting frameworks is the *how*. What are you going to *do* that will make your goal a reality?

In order to accomplish a goal (or achieve an objective), you have to actually get started. And that often means figuring out what steps you're going to take, or what tactics you're going to use.

> What action can you take on a daily basis that will inevitably produce the result you're after?

So if you're twelve-week objective is to read more,your tactic could be to read at least 20 pages of a book per day. In 30 days, you should have two books finished and in sixty days you should have four books completed.

# üü® Chris Herd's predictions for the next decade of remote work

[[Chris Herd]] has spoken to 1,500 people about remote work and has formulated the following predictions based on those conversations:

**Rural Living:** Smart, talented, and skilled people will move to smaller cities looking for a lower cost of living and a higher quality of life.

**Asynchronous Work:** Offices are currently built around a synchronous mode of work, but will migrate to an asynchronous form

**Hobby Renaissance:** Remote work will give people time to invest in hobbies and activities and connect them to their local community

**Diversity & Inclusion:** Talent will compete globally, leading to the most diverse and inclusive teams in history

**Output Focus:** Rather than an emphasis on time spent working, performance will be based on output

**Private Equity:** There will be a lot of money made by purchasing companies and shifting them to remote-first

**Working Too Much:** At first, people will work too much and burn out

**Remote Retreats:** An industry will develop around leading remote retreats for large companies. They'll have purpose-built destinations that would allow entire companies to fly in for a synchronous week

**Life-Work Balance:** People's priorities will change and shift more towards life over their work. Rather than organizing their life around work, they'll do the opposite (organize work around their life)

**Bullshit Tasks:** People won't need to pad their day to reach 8 hours. Instead, they'll work on clear tasks and have specific responsibilities

**Health & Wellbeing:** By not having to commute, workers will have a lot more time to dedicate to their health and well being. 

**Personal RPA:** No-code tools and robotic process automation will transform how people work, empowering them to automate the drudge work for themselves

**Death of HQ:** Some form of HQ offices will persist, but they'll be rarely used. Instead, people will use co-working spaces and working from home for most of their time

**Remove Living:** Work from anywhere RVs and RV parks will become a huge business

**Life-work Balance:** More and more people will freelance and work part-time

**Community Led SaaS:** As the barrier to entry for building a competitive SaaS product continue to lower, the tech won't be the important part - the community will be

**Remote Visas:** Small nations will offer special visas for people who want to work remotely

**Meeting Death:** People won't travel to long meetings anymore because the benefits of meeting in-person will erode quickly

**Personal Choice:** People will have the choice to work remotely

**Written over Spoken:** Documentation and other forms of written communication will become crucial for the success of any remote team. People who are more likely to succeed in a remote-first world will be great writers

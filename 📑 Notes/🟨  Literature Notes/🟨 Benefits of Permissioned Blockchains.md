# Benefits of Permissioned Blockchains

What are the benefits to permissioned blockchain networks, over public networks?

It depends on the implementation. [[ðŸŸ¨ What is a Permissioned Blockchain? | Permissioned blockchains]] are generally for very specific use cases.

Generally speaking, there are four benefits to using a permissioned blockchain:
- Performance
- Governance Structure
- Decentralized Storage
- Cost Efficiency

**Performance:**

When compared to public blockchains, permissioned blockchains offer better performance. This is by nature of the fact that there are fewer nodes in the network, by design. With fewer networks, it's easier computationally to establish consensus, which in turn improves the overall performance of the whole network.

In addition, permissioned blockchains tend to have a certain subset of nodes specifically for validating transactions. This has the added benefit of increasing performance by reducing further the number of nodes needed to establish consensus.

**Governance Structure:**

A defining factor of a permissioned blockchain is its governance structure. In public networks, these are less defined and making changes is more difficult and takes more time.

In permissioned blockchains, these can be customized to suit the needs of the specific problem set and they can be updated more easily and quickly by administrators.

**Decentralized Storage:**

It's still a blockchain, meaning that everyone has a copy of the ledger, which is stored in each node (decentralized). So you get all the benefits of blockchain.

**Cost Efficiency:**

Because there are fewer nodes, it is cheaper to run and maintain the blockchain network.

It can additionally be cost effective to use a blockchain, in place of an alternative solution.

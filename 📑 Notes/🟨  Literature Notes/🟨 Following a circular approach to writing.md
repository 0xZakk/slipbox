# ðŸŸ¨ Following a circular approach to writing

There are two approaches to writing: **linear** and **circular**.

Most people follow a **linear** approach. The linear approach is also recommended by most resources on learning to write.

In the linear approach, you start with an idea of what to write about. Then you collect and review all the relevant research. Once you've done that, you craft an outline before writing a draft. Then you revise your draft and submit it for feedback. In academic writing, this is the point where you'd submit your draft to journals for review.

There are many problems with linear writing, but one of the biggest problems is that the feedback comes at the end of the cycle. Only after you've spent months working on a paper do you get an idea of whether or not the idea was any good.

Instead, we should aim to follow a **circular** approach to writing where we receive different kinds of feedback at each stage of the process. Using a Slipbox naturally gives us this kind of feedback.

Using a Slipbox naturally forces us into a **circular** approach to writing as we get feedback at each step of the process. For instance, in making literature notes, we get feedback on how well we understand an author or a text. In writing permanent notes, we get feedback on how well we thought through our own ideas.

What is Sovereignty?

It's easier to start by identifying what sovereignty is not.

Too many men have lost control of their hearts and minds. In seeking a painless life, they have traded the individual liberty and personal responsibility for a decent marriage and a steady paycheck. They have sought comfort and, without realizing it, enslaved themselves to their marriages, jobs, and governments. They are living in what Ryan calls [[🟨 The Cloud of Delusion | the Cloud of Delusion]].

These men shirk the responsibilities they have as men and instead take the path of least resistance.

So, what is Sovereignty?

It's the power that you inherently have to control the outcome of your life. It's about control. It's about ownership. It's about facing the ugly reality that you aren't as good as you think you are and that the life you live today is not the one you're meant to live.

Having Sovereignty -- or being a [[🟨 Sovereign Man | Sovereign Man]] -- means you've decided to fight the battle and take ownership of your life and everything in it. It means taking responsibility for your life and those in it and, specifically, your responsibilities as a man to protect, provide, and preside (What Ryan calls the [[🟨 Three Traits of a Sovereign Man | Three Traits of a Sovereign Man]])

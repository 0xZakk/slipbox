# ðŸŸ¨ Blockchain Consortium
A blockchain network built on Hyperledger Fabric is made of multiple nodes of different node types (i.e. Peer nodes and Ordering nodes). Every node and user needs to belong to an organization that is a member of the blockchain network. This group of organizations that are members of a Fabric network is referred to as the consortium.

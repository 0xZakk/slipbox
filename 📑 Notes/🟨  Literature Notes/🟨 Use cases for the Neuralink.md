# ðŸŸ¨ Use cases for the Neuralink

Toward Syncing Our Brains With AI [[ðŸŸ¦ Elon Muskâ€™s Neuralink: Both an evolution and a plan for radical change]] 

Near to mid-term, someone with a Neuralink implant would be able to interact with the world around them through brain activity read and processed by the implant.

For example, someone who is paralyzed could use their Neuralink implant to "type" on a computer. The implant would read the signals created by their brain and translate that into text on another computer.

A longer-term use case is that someone who is paralyzed due to a spinal injury could have multiple Neuralink implants reading signals from different parts of their brain that are then sent to a secondary device that stimulates electrical activity to control motor function.

- Go code is organized in packages. This is the case even for small Go programs.
- You define a new package with the `package` keyword. To import a package, you use the `import` keyword.
- You can name your package anything, except under one condition: when you are defining a package that you intend to use as an executable application. In that case, you must name the package `main`.

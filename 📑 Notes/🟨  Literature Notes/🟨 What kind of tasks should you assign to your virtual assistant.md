- The key thing to managing a virtual assistant is to assign them a variety of different tasks. You want to give them a good mix of administrative work, long-term projects, and projects that will level them up.
- Having a good mix of projects means that they will always have something to work on, even if there isn't a project with an immediate deadline.
- **Administrative projects**
    - These are the kinds of projects that you probably think of when you think of working with a virtual assistant. Things like:
        - Transcribing client meetings and sending notes around to all attendees
        - Researching something for you
        - Fixing small technical issues or billing issues
- **Long-term Projects**
    - These are projects that are a high priority but aren't urgent; things you want to complete eventually. Think of things like:
        - Researching and creating a list of conferences and speaking engagements with their application deadlines, as well as applying for them.
- **Learning Projects**
    - These are projects that will improve what your VA is capable of over time.

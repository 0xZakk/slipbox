Creating habits has a number of advantages over goal-setting, even if you are trying to achieve a goal. Setting out to run every day is a more effective way of achieving the goal of running a marathon than trying to stick to a marathon training program.

What are the advantages of habits over goals?

1. **Habits are performed automatically.** Once a habit is set, you don't have to think about performing it. You'll just do it automatically and may not even notice when you do it (depending on the habit).
2. **They're easy to complete.** Once you've established a habit, your brain rewires itself so it's actually easier to perform the habit than not to.
3. **They compound over time.** Over time, your habits can become your character.
4. **You can start as small as you need.** You can start as small as necessary: floss one tooth before bed, read 1 page, run for 1 block. Once the habit is established, you can ratchet up the habit.
5. **They last for life.** Once a habit is set, it's very hard to unset. For habits we set intentionally, that's good. It means that it'll be hard for us to undo that habit. 
6. **You can overshoot your goal.** A habit like running every day can mean you overshoot your goal of running a marathon.

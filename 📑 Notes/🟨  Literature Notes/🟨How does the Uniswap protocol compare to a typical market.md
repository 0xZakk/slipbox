title: ðŸŸ¨How does the Uniswap protocol compare to a typical market
type: "literature"
---

The Uniswap protocol functions differently than the order book markets of traditional finance. There are two key differences to understand:

1. How the Automated Market Maker (AMM) works compared to order book exchanges
2. How permissionless markets differ from permissioned markets

## Order Book Markets v. Automated Market Makers

Traditional markets use a central limit order book method of exchange. That means that buyers and sellers of an asset, like a stock, create orders at different prices that are filled by demand. A buy order at a certain price is matched when a sell order at that price is created.

An Automated Market Maker uses a liquidity pool of two assets that are valued relative to each other. As the assets are traded, their prices shift. Buyers and sellers also trade directly with the pool, rather than with each other.

## Permissionless

The Uniswap protocol is permissionless by design. That means that it is publicly usable by anyone and access can't be restricted. Anyone can participate in any of the functions of the protocol, including swapping, providing liquidity, and creating new markets.

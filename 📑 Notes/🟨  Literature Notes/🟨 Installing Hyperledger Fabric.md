- Installing Hyperledger Fabric on your machine is a relatively straightforward process. There unfortunately isn't an installer or a way to install it through homebrew.
- The process for installing Hyperledger Fabric is:
    - Clone a repository from GitHub,
    - Check out the appropriate version tag (if necessary)
    - Install a set of binaries and config files by running a shell script,
    - Download a set of Docker images
- While there isn't an installer, there is a script that you can download and execute that takes care of most of this for you.
- **Installing Hyperledger Fabric**
    - First, clone the [hyperledger/fabric-samples](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples) repository. This repository contains everything you need to install and configure Hyperledger Fabric to work on your machine. It also contains a couple of sample networks and applications, which you can use to learn from.
    - Second, change in to the directory you cloned above and execute the following command: `curl -sSL https://bit.ly/2ysbOFE | bash -s`.
        - This command is using cURL, which we downloaded previous, to fetch and download a bash script. It is then piping that script to bash, which executes it.
        - The executed script pulls the necessary binaries and places them in the `/bin` directory of the repository. You'll want to add this directory to your path, so that these binaries are available through the command line.
        - Then the script downloads the Docker images for Hyperledger Fabric. It will download quite a few Docker images, so this might take some time.

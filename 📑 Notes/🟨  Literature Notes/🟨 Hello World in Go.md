- Here is how you write Hello World in Go:
- ```javascript
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
  fmt.Println("Hello World!")
}```
- We start off on line 1 by declaring our package and package name, in this case, `main`.
- After that we import the `fmt` package, which is a part of the Go standard library.
- At the end, we define a function called `main` which uses the `fmt` package method `Println` to print the string `"Hello World!"` to standard out.

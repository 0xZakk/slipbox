# What is the purpose of literature notes?

A literature note should be a note on a part of a reference that is explained briefly and in your own words. You shouldn't spend too long on literature notes, as the real value of the Slipbox comes from the permanent notes. Additionally, you should turn your fleeting notes into literature notes as soon as possible after making them.

- [[Balaji S. Srinivasan]] offers five theories for why we aren't current in the middle of a golden age of productivity, despite all the technological advances that have happened in our lifetime.
- The Great Distraction
    - All the gains in productivity have been wasted on equal and opposite gains in entertainment, like social media, which distract from increased productivity
- The Great Dissipation
    - The gains in productivity have been dissipated through society with increases in compliance, process, forms, and red tape
- The Great Divergence
    - The gains in productivity are unequally distributed so as to be only harnessed by a few people and companies
- The Great Dilemma
    - Increases in productivity have been wasted or halted by increased red tape, making the cost of productivity relatively the same when adjusted
- The Great Dumbness
    - The West hasn't harnessed increased productivity as well as China

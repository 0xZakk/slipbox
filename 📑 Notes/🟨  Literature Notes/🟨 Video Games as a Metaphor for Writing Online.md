- Video games are a metaphor for writing online.
- Video games are a permission-less container where you can experiment with strategies, build skills, and study incentives. This can be a training ground for identifying and working with incentives in the real world
- Writing on the internet is similar:
    - Writing online is permission-less (anyone can start)
    - Writing online has an element of luck to it, similar to video games

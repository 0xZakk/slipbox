- We currently live in the information age of the internet. But, thanks to blockchain, we are shifting to the value age of the internet.
- **Internet of Information**
- Right now, the internet is about exchanging information (data, text, etc). The first wave of the internet was about democratizing information. Things like Wikipedia make the world's knowledge easily accessible to everyone.
- There are some limitations around how this works that stand in the way of the next era.
- When I send you an email, you actually receive a copy of that email. When you load a page of a website, you receive a copy of it. This works well for the exchange of information, but doesn't work for exchanging things of value.
- If I wire you $100, it's really important that I don't have that money anymore.
- We've temporarily solved this problem with gate-keepers and centralized sources of authority.
- When I wire you $100, the banking system does a ton of stuff that takes a ton of time to ensure that you have the money now and I don't. Banks are just one example of these centralized gatekeepers. But every large internet resource that you can think of falls into this category.
- Facebook is the centralized gatekeeper for online interaction and the exchange of personal updates. AirBnB is the centralized gatekeeper for people renting rooms.
- **Internet of Value**
- Blockchain will facilitate the transition from the Internet of Information to the Internet of Value. With the wide-scale adoption of blockchain, we'll not only be able to transfer information over the internet, we'll be able to transfer value as well. And we'll be able to do it without third-party facilitators who take a large cut.
- Bitcoin is the start of this revolution. Bitcoin is a form of digital cash that can be used as a real currency on- and offline. With Bitcoin, I can wire you $100 and I wont have that money anymore (ie, it solves the double-spend problem) and we can do it all almost instantly without banks or third parties.
- The next logical step is to do this with other goods and services.

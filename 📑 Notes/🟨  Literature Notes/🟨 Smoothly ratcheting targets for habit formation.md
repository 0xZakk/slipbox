In addition to [[ðŸŸ¨ Using a moving weekly window to form habits | using a moving weekly window]], you can improve your odds at successful habit formation by smoothly ratcheting up your target.

Fine-grained targets tend to work best. So instead of going from running 3x per week to 4, run a little longer/further but keep the cadence at 3x per week.

The value of fine-grained ratcheted targets is that they are more flexible. If your goal is to run 10 miles per week, you can break that up into the following configurations:

* 3 miles, 3 miles, 4 miles
* 5 miles, 3 miles 2 miles
* 4 miles, 4 miles, 2 miles

All of these will hit your goal.

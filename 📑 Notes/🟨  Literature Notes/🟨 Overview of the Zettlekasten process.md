- The Zettlekasten process in Roam involves three steps:
- Step 1: Make Literature Notes. These are notes on the things you're reading that you don't want to forget. They should be brief and in your own words.
- Step 2: Make Reference Notes. Reference Notes are a way for you to remember the sources of your Literature Notes.
- Step 3: Make Permanent Notes. There are two parts to Permanent notes. First, you write about the ideas in your Literature Notes in your own words and framed towards the problems you're thinking about. Second, you connect your Permanent Note to other Permanent Notes in the Zettelkasten.

When Ryan served in the military, his group adopted the mantra, "complacency kills." If any solder were late to their post or slacked off even just a little bit, it could mean death - their own or that of another soldier.

While the stakes aren't that high for you, the mantra still fits: any amount of slacking off will lead to a life you hate.

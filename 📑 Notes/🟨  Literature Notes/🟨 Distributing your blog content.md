- The following are a series of tips from [[Monica Lent]] on how to distribute your blog posts, once they are written.
    1. **Submit your sitemap in Google Search Console.** While Google will automatically redrawn your site for new content, you can submit your sitemap manually and trigger Google to do this.
    2. **Share your content on Twitter.** It's okay to use one or two hashtags when you do. You should also tag any companies or technologies that you mention in your blog post, as those handles may retweet your post.
    3. **Post your article on LinkedIn.** LinkedIn is a great distribution option for some forms of content, especially anything related to product management or something a company might want to reshare.
    4. **Post your article on Reddit.** You can share your blog posts in relevant subreddits if you're an active member of that community.
    5. **Post your article on Hacker News.** Posting to Hacker News can give you a huge boost to your audience, but the comments in your article will be terrible.
    6. **Syndicate your article.** You can cross-post and syndicate your article to developer-related websites like ThePracticalDev. Just be sure to set the canonical URL to the original article under your domain. It's also a good idea to leave a note at the end directing readers to your website.
    7. **Send your new article to your email list.** If you set up an RSS feed, then you can automate this process. Alternatively, ConvertKit makes it really easy to to automate distributing articles to your newsletter whenever you post something new.

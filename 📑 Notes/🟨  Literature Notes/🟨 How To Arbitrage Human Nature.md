# How To Arbitrage Human Nature

Human nature changes very slowly, on the scale of a millennium. However, we live in the day-to-day, where it feels like things are changing quickly.

The opportunity for arbitrage is to find the things that are time-tested and to leverage them against the noise of every day life.

To be clear, things are changing. The example in [[ðŸŸ¦  How To Arbitrage Human Nature]] is how the markets have changed. They're now digitized and populated by high-frequency traders. It's easy to feel that this game has fundamentally changed and so the individual can't increase their wealth on the market anymore.

While these things are true, the underlying mechanism of the market is exactly the same: the price of a stock is still determined by people, who are subject to all the same biases and misjudgments that they always have been.

In order to arbitrage human nature, you have to see that the specifics change quickly, while the fundamentals change very, very slowly. These day-to-day changes in circumstances create a lot of noise. The signal can be found by looking for time-tested ideas and models.

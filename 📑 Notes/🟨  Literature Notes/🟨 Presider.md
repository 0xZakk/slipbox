To preside is to lead those you have an obligation and responsibility to lead, including yourself. Your ability to lead in every area of your life is a huge part of what makes you a man.

Becoming a presider and a Sovereign Man requires recognizing that you are the ultimate authority in your life. You are in charge. No one else is.

Many men are scared of recognizing this and, therefore, scared of leading themselves. It's understandable: one of the ways that masculinity has been attacked is in the way we've been conditioned to ask permission. The idea was to settle boys down and to make them manageable for tired teachers and parents. The result is men who are waiting for permission to answer a calling they feel deep inside. What many of these men don't know is that taking the first step is the only thing that will give themselves a fighting chance.

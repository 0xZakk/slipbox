# ðŸŸ¨ Bundling and memory

Research into human memory has generally proven that people are able to keep about seven things in their working memory (plus or minus two). There's a chance that it's even lower than that. So how do memory artists remember a huge quantity of data? They use a technique called __bundling__.

When you use a memorization technique, you're bundling items together in a meaningful way so that your brain can remember the bundle. Each bundle is treated separately and so takes up one "slot" of working memory.

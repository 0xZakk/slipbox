Every day of your life is a battle for the kind of man you want to be. Many men opt out of the fight and, by being passive, lead a life they're not proud of. They give up the rather than fight. Opting out of the fight gets you a dissatisfying life of mediocrity. Fighting the fight for your sovereignty can get you a life you love.

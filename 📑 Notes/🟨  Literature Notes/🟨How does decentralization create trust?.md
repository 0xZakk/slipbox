Blockchains solve the [[ðŸŸ¨What problem does blockchain solve? | placement of trust issue]] with decentralization. But how does decentralization create trust?

When assets of value are recorded on a single ledger (i.e. basic bookkeeping), it's easy for the bookkeeper to manipulate the record.

When assets of value are recorded a two ledgers (i.e. double-entry bookkeeping), it's more difficult. But two bookkeepers can conspire to manipulate the record for their own gain.

When assets of value are recorded on a decentralized ledger (i.e. n-entry bookkeeping where n is the number of participants), it's practically impossible to manipulate the ledger because it would require coordinating among a very large number of people to alter the record at the same time.

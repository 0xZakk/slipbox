Generally speaking, there are two formal approaches to forming new habits:

1. Chaining - Starting "cold turkey", developing a streak, and trying to maintain that streak for as long as possible (i.e. "don't break the chain").
2. Scheduling - Picking specific times and/or places to perform a habit and trying to keep that schedule (i.e. Go to the gym every day after work).

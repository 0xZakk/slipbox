# What is the purpose of fleeting notes?

The purpose of fleeting notes is to capture ideas or thoughts quickly so that they can be processed later. The notes you take when you're listening to a lecture or in a conversation are examples of fleeting notes. So are the notes you make to jot down an idea that popped into your head. Finally, the highlights and notes you make in a book are examples of fleeting notes.

**It's important to note that fleeting notes are only valuable if you come back through and review them within a day or so.** That's because these kinds of notes are just meant as **__reminders__** of a thought or an idea that you will elaborate later.

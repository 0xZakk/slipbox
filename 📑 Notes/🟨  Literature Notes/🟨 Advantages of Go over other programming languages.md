# Advantages of Go over other programming languages

Like any programming languages, Go is better suited for some tasks over others. And there are some applications where Go is the best option out there. ^0c6f50

The language itself has a number of advantages over others:
- Because Go is compiled, you can avoid a number of errors that would produce runtime bugs
- The language itself is easier to read than C, C++, or Java because it doesn't use as many parentheses and doesn't use any semicolons.
- Go has built-in support for concurrency through goroutines and channels. While goroutines are not as powerful as OS thread, they are very lightweight and performant.

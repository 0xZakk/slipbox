- According to self-determination theory, there are three things that make work satisfying:
    - **Autonomy** - Do you have control over your time and actions?
    - **Competence** - Are you developing skills for non-trivial work?
    - **Relatedness** - Are you connected to the people around you? Do you feel loved and respected by the people you work with and do you love and respect them?

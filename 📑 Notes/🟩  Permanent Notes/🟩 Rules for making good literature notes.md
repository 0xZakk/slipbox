# Rules for making good literature notes

There are two important rules to making good literature notes:

First, the notes must be in your own words. You cannot copy and paste, quote, or export. The goal of writing literature notes is to help you understand and elaborate on what you're reading and writing these notes in your own words is the only way to do that.

Second, the notes must be brief. This is to prevent pollution. The goal of this slip box isn't to have a million notes, but to have valuable notes, each with valuable connections to other notes. The value is in the quality of the notes and in their connection to other notes, not in the quantity of notes.

# Creating Literature Notes

There are two steps to making literature notes:
1. Getting your highlights into Roam
2. Summarizing those highlights into literature notes

## Step 1: Getting highlights into Roam

### From a Physical Book
As you read a physical book, you should highlight or underline passages that are important for things you're writing about or problems that you're trying to solve.

When you finish the book go back through with the Readwise app on your phone and record highlights into Readwise. Then, export your highlights from Readwise and add them to the reference notes in Roam.

You should also go through the book and add any literature notes you made in marginalia to Roam.

### From Kindle

If you're reading a book on your kindle, then the process of creating reference notes is pretty similar. Highlight important passages as you go. Then import those highlights in to the reference note.

### From an Article

The best way to create reference notes on articles and web pages is to use a tool like Instapaper or another read-it-later app that lets you highlight and export those highlights.

If you're using Instapaper, then highlight the passages you want to turn into literature notes so that you can export them and add them to a reference note in Roam. Using a tool like Readwise makes this a lot easier.

Another great option is to use a Roam reading plugin like Roam Highlighter or Eloquent.

If you go with this option, then highlight passages as you read the article or web page. When you finish, export the highlights directly to a reference note in Roam.

### From a Video

Taking notes from a video can be a little tricky. You have two options here.

First, you can split your window so the video is in one half of the screen and Roam is in the other. As you watch the video, record your notes directly into a reference note for that video.

Second, you can get the transcript of the video, which you can then read and highlight and treat as you would an article or webpage.

## Step 2: Turning highlights into literature notes

Once you have all the reference notes, it's time to create literature notes for them. It's really important to follow the [[游릴 Rules for making good literature notes | rules of literature notes]]:

"First, the notes must be in your own words. You cannot copy and paste, quote, or export. The goal of writing literature notes is to help you understand and elaborate on what you're reading and writing these notes in your own words is the only way to do that."

"Second, the notes must be brief. This is to prevent pollution. The goal of this slip box isn't to have a million notes, but to have valuable notes, each with valuable connections to other notes. The value is in the quality of the notes and in their connection to other notes, not in the quantity of notes."

Start by creating a new page for your literature notes, separate from the reference note.

Then go through your highlights in the reference note and summarize the key points in the literature notes. This can mean summarizing highlights in your own words. It can also mean organizing your notes into your own index.

The goal here is to make this an active process. How can you summarize and distill this information in your own words? Additionally, how can you orient this information towards problems in your work or topics you're writing about.

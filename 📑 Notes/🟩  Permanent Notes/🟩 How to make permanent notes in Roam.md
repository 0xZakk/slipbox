# How to make permanent notes in Roam

The quality of your slipbox depends on the number of well written permanent notes you have. They are the most important part of your slipbox as they are what ultimately makes it possible to connect ideas and produce written works.

To create permanent notes, you simply need to go back through your literature notes and summarize them in your own words. Think of this as building the lego pieces or bricks that will eventually become an article or some other completed project.

Because you want you want your permanent notes to become the building blocks of future ideas, it's really important that you write out your ideas in full sentences with appropriate references to texts. Think of it as writing a sentence that you could just drag and drop into an article. 

The process of making permanent notes is relatively straightforward:
- Create a new page in Roam
- Add in the meta data for a permanent note
- Write your permanent note. Here, it's helpful to have the literature notes you're summarizing open in the sidebar. If you need to, you can drag in block references while you write the permanent note. Just be sure to delete them later.
- Once the notes that make up the permanent note are written, you need to add a few key pieces of information to complete the note.
- First, you need to add the source of the note. That way you can go back to the original source where this idea or thought came from.
- Second, you need to add relevant keywords to the notes. Don't think of keywords as a way of categorizing this note. Instead, think of the keywords as connecting the note to a context in which you would want to stumble upon this note again sometime in the future.
- Third, you need to make connections between your new permanent note and existing permanent notes in your slipbox.

# Definition of a Literature Note

Literature notes are notes from articles, videos, books, and other sources.

In a Zettelkasten, literature notes are for things you don't want to forget or that you may use later in your writing. They are the building block for later written works.

Literature note are __not__ highlights. Highlights should go inside the Reference note where they can be referred back to. But your literature notes should be in your own words and summarize your understanding of the reference's key points.

# Definition of a Reference Note

A reference note is a note in your Slipbox that performs two functions:
1. Save the reference information for some information or knowledge
2. Store highlights from a reference source

## Reference Information

The first function of a reference note is to provide the reference information for a source you have read. A source could be anything that you consume: books, articles, blog posts, documentation, videos, podcasts, etc.

When you finish taking notes on a source, create a page for it with the bibliographic information (author, link, year, etc).

Whenever you want to reference this source, use a link to this note. That can be in your literature notes and permanent notes related to this source. It can also be in your writing, when you want to source information you learned.

## Highlights

The second function of a reference note is to store your highlights and annotations on a source. Once you've added the bibliographic information to a reference note, import or copy in your highlights.

It's important to treat these highlights as a backup and not as material for you to use. We want to store our highlights so we have them in Roam and can reference them later, but the likelihood of our highlights serving any function to us is very small. So don't stop here and don't treat your highlights as important. Your literature and permanent notes are what is important.

Why save your highlights in Roam then? There are a few reasons:

First, it will make it easier to create literature notes, which is the next step in the process. You'll be able to open your highlights in the sidebar as you write your literature notes in the main window.

Second, we will be able to easily reference back to the main source material if we're looking for a quote or want to verify something the author said.

Third, we can have them handy as our understanding develops and our interpretation changes. Early on, you'll be creating permanent notes drawing from a few sources. But as your database grows, you'll start to draw from more sources to create permanent notes and your existing permanent notes will adapt as you read more.

Being able to reference back to your highlights will make all this easier by, for instance, being able to reference highlights from two sources on the same topic.

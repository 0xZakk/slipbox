# Cassette Exchange

You and some friends decide to run a cassette exchange. The idea is that anyone in this exchange can borrow a cassette from anyone else. You all want to keep track of your cassettes, so you make an agreement not to lend them outside of the group.

You lend Southern Accents by Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers to Mark and after a few weeks decide you want it back. Mark, however, says he has lent it to Alice. But when you speak to Alice, she says she never borrowed it. Who has your cassette? And who do you trust?

In a small group like this it's easy to identify that Mark was the last person to hold Southern Accents and so is most likely the person who lost or stole it. As the cassette exchange group increases in numbers, you need to keep track of who lends what cassettes.

You decide to invite a fourth friend, Jane, to join the cassette exchange. And from now on you all appoint Jane to keep track of who owns each cassette and who has borrowed a cassette. That way, you can easily spot if someone steals one and you can trace it back to the last person who held it.

A few weeks later, you go searching for a cassette of yours (Born in the USA by Bruce Springsteen) and once again it's been misplaced. When you look at Jane's records though, they show that you never lent it out. Now who has your cassette? And who do you trust?

We've encountered a common problem with record keeping. We trust the record keeper to maintain accurate records, but what if the record keeper isn't trustworthy?

## Introduction
Welcome to the user manual for this Slipbox!
The goal of this document is to orient and guide you through using this database, which is different from your previous database.
This document starts with the most important pieces: the process overview, which explains the processes at a high level. This is a great section to read if you want to reflect or revisit on the context of this database.
The second section of this document gives you specific instructions on how to perform each step of the process. Think of each step here as a tutorial or user guide on how to best perform each step. However, like any tutorial, it is aimed at a specific time and place and can't encompass all possible futures or scenarios. So expect to adapt these tutorials to the material and situation in front of you.
Finally, the third section walks through the 3 different note types and provides an explanation for each of them. These are your understanding of what the notes are, how they work, and how best to create them.
**Note:** This is not a static document and you should not treat it as one. Instead, treat it as a letter from your former self that you can revisit and revise as necessary. When you wrote this, the goal was to cement the process in writing, so that you could develop your understanding of it and so that you could return to this document for instructions as you built up these steps as habits. The whole purpose of this Slipbox is to serve your writing. So if something needs to change, then change it.
## Process Overview
We'll start with an overview of the process. Think of this section as providing context for how this database works. The next section will contain a series of tutorials for you to follow with more concrete steps. Without the context provided in this section, the steps provided in the next section wont have much meaning. So it's important to get this context first.
### Reading and Note-Taking
This is where it all starts.
You should take notes as you read or watch something. These notes and highlights will become the kindling for your work. Whether you're reading a physical book or watching a lecture video online, taking notes and highlights and save them somewhere you'll be able to easily access them.
With physical books, you should read with a highlighter and/or a pen, so that you can annotate the book with sections you want to copy into your reference notes. With books you read on a Kindle, you just have to highlight the passages you want to save and then use Readwise to export them to Evernote and then import them into Roam. The process you use to read books on a Kindle works roughly the same as the process of reading and highlighting articles in Instapaper. Readwise can pull in your highlights from Instapaper and export them to Roam. 
These highlights are the base material that you will use to start the processes.  Your highlights will be saved in a Reference Note and used to generate Literature Notes. 
### Making Reference Notes
You need a way to reference back to your sources from within your Roam Slipbox and the best way to do this is to create Reference Notes.
For every book, article, or lecture that you read or watch and take notes on, you should create a Reference Note to store your highlights and to reference back to in your Literature Notes and Permanent Notes.
The process of creating Reference Notes is relatively simple. You want to create a new page for each reference note with the bibliographic information about the source. Then paste in your highlights and notes from the source.
Copying in your highlights is optional and many people would recommend not doing it. The important thing to remember is that your highlights and notes aren't really worth anything. I recommend copying them in so that it's easier to use them to make Literature Notes, which is all your highlights are really useful for.
Making highlights and putting them into Reference Notes should be a really easy and low-effort process. Your goal is to make this part seamless and easy, so that you can focus on making Literature Notes and turning those Literature Notes into Permanent Notes.
### Making Literature Notes 
The process of making Literature Notes is where you start to work with the ideas expressed by the author. A Literature Note is simply your understanding of the arguments expressed by the literature source in the Reference Note.
Making a Literature Note requires creating a new page, linking it back to the Reference Note, and then translating the authors words into your own notes.
There are two important rules that you must follow when creating Literature Notes:
First, you must write the notes in your own words. You cannot copy and paste or quote the original source. You must translate the notes into your own words every time. This will help you elaborate on the author's words, giving you a deeper understanding of the material and ultimately help you learn it so you can create Permanent Notes.
Second, the notes must be brief. Don't create notes for the sake of creating notes, as the goal of the Slipbox isn't to have a lot of notes but to have high quality notes. Keep your notes brief and to the point. Summarize and condense as much as possible.
The Literature Notes will help you understand a source, which will in turn help you make Permanent Notes. 
### Making Permanent Notes
"The quality of your slipbox depends on the number of well written permanent notes you have. They are the most important part of your slipbox as they are what ultimately makes it possible to connect ideas and produce written works."

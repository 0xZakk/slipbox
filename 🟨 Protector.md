One of the key roles of being a man is protecting those around you and those in need. Men are bigger than women -- taller, stronger, faster. Throughout all of history, these biological traits have been used by Men to protect their families and their tribes.

Therefore, one of the key traits of a Sovereign man is his ability to protect.

How each man protects his circle will be slightly different. But there are somethings that every man must do, at a minimum, so that his Sovereignty isn't limited. Those things are:

**Situational Awareness**

Are you aware of what is happening around you? If someone were to walk into a space with the intent to cause harm, would you notice before it's too late?

The goal here isn't to be paranoid. Rather, it's to understand and observe the environment around you and to react accordingly.

**Readiness**

How prepared and capable are you of protecting yourself and your loved ones in a tough situation?

This doesn't just mean being physically strong -- though it does mean that. It also means being strong mentally by having fortitude and resilience in a difficult situation.

**Weapons of War**

It's an unfortunate fact that, at some point in your life, you may have to stand up to violence. You should spend time learning self-defense and get basic combat training. You should also learn the basics of handling a firearm. The goal is never to start violence. Nor is the goal to make the situation worse. The goal is to be able to end it quickly before much damage is done.

**Provisions**

In war, supply lines are what differentiate a successful campaign from a failed one. So to it is with life. Are you adequately prepared if you need to get out of town quickly? Are you prepared to go without running water and easy access to a grocery store? You may never need it, but you should be prepared for it anyway.

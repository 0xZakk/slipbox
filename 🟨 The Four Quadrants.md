You will likely have lots of objectives and things you want to change. While it's good to have so much initiative, you can't change everything at once. Change will take a long time and much of it will be the result of focusing on the four quadrants:

1. Calibration - taking care of yourself first, so that you can take care of others. 
2. Connection - developing deep relationships with people who can help you.
3. Condition - becoming physically strong.
4. Contribution - becoming a man who creates value.

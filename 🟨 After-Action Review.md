The After-Action Review is a powerful tool to fuel your growth and maintain your sovereignty.

Things wont always work out. There will be time when you fail or backslide on the path to becoming a Sovereign Man. Whether you win or lose an individual battle shouldn't matter too much in the grand scheme of things. The way to capitalize on every victory or defeat is to write an After-Action Review.

The After-Action Review is a series of five questions that you should ask yourself after every encounter, exercise, project, conversation -- anything. You use these five questions to uncover your weaknesses and analyze the things you did wrong. You also use these questions to uncover your strengths and examine the things you did right.

The five questions are:

1. **What did I accomplish?** Did you accomplish the things you set out to accomplish? Did you accomplish your objective? Be honest with yourself. You either did or you didn't. You can't actually fool yourself and trying to will lead you to backslide.
2. **What did I not accomplish?** Whether you were successful in the objectives, there are definitely things you can work to improve on. What are those things?
3. **What did I do well?** Every man has strengths and far too often they don't recognize these. Whether you completed the objective or not, this is the opportunity to reflect on the things you did well.
4. **What did I not do well?** Not only does every man have his strengths, every man also has his weaknesses. Regardless of the outcome of your action, what can you improve on? What did you not do well?
5. **What will I do differently moving forward?** This is the most powerful question of the After-Action Review. How are you going to expand on the actions you've taken up to this point? Use this question to look to behaviors, resources, people, technology, information, and /or ideas that you need to incorporate to be more effective next time.

# CabinDAO Creator Residency Proposals

So much has happened with CabinDAO that it’s hard to believe it’s been only three weeks since Jon, Jonathan, and I were all hanging in Texas. Sitting around the fire three weeks ago, I don’t think we could have been imagined how positive of a reception we’d receive for this wild idea. But since we first shared our proposal, we’ve raised 16 ETH and fully kick started this DAO. We have a very active discord server of new online friends and have already turned some of those connections into IRL friends.

That brings us to our next big announcement: **we’re ready to start accepting applicants for the very first cohort of CabinDAO creators!**

The first cohort will run from **XXX** to **XXX**. We will accept proposals from **XXX** to **XXX** and will open voting on **XXX**. Voting for proposals will close on **XXX** at which time the four proposals with the most number of votes will be selected to participate in the first cohort. The rest of this article walks through the information you need to submit a proposal.

## Submitting a Proposal

Submitting a proposal couldn’t be easier. All you have to do is write and share a thread on Twitter and include the hashtag `#CabinDAOProposal` in the first tweet. We’ll gather these threads and coordinate a vote among our members to determine the four creators to be selected in the first cohort.

### What to Include in Your Proposal

Use this as an opportunity to be creative. It would be good to introduce yourself to the community and share some of your past work. We would also love to see some rough, initial thoughts on how you would like to spend the time in Texas. You don’t need to provide a fully fleshed out plan. Just the kernel of a promising idea that’s been bouncing around your head.

A good proposal will include:
- An introduction to who you are and what you do
- Some past work samples
- An idea for how you’d like to spend your time while at the cabins
- Other useful information

While I can’t speak for the rest of the community, I can say that my own personal votes will go to creative proposals with wild ideas.

### Proposal Period

The time to submit a proposal will run from **XXX** to **XXX**. All threads posted during that period will be considered for a vote. Proposals submitted after the proposal period ends will be considered for the second cohort. 

## When Voting Starts

The proposal period will end on **XXX** and we will take some time to turn those proposals into a vote on Snapshot. We will then vote as a community on Scattershot. $CABIN holders will have until **XXX** to vote on proposals. 

We will provide further instructions to $CABIN holders on how to place your votes before voting starts.

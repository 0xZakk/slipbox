    - **Making Permanent Notes**
    - When you have a good collection of literature notes you can start to create permanent notes. Permanent notes are like mini summaries of a topic that draw from multiple literature notes.
    - Literature notes can come from different sources. In fact, I think that makes the permanent note stronger!

    - **Using Your Permanent Notes**
    - As you build up permanent notes, you'll be able to start compiling these into projects. I use this system to write articles, but a project could generally be anything. I've been experimenting with using it for technical projects too.
    - Collect a couple of related permanent notes and summarize them into something you can edit, get feedback on, and eventually publish:

    - **Conclusion**
    - To recap, the system as a whole looks like this:

    **Introduction**
    After eight months of daily Roam usage for about 8 months, I've scrapped my old database and started fresh from a new one. Well, I haven't deleted the old one, but I only visit it for something I remember reading as I migrate to a new database.
    Roam is an incredibly powerful tool that, unlike other note-taking tools, doesn't provide or enforce much on you in the way of structure. What do I mean by that? Well, in Evernote, you have to put your notes into a hierarchy: you create folders and subfolders and sub-subfolders and any new note you create has to go in one of them. Roam doesn't work that way. In Roam, you create pages and you link those pages to other pages. Overtime, you develop __contexts__, or clusters of related pages. But there's nothing in the way of hierarchy or structure.
    This is extremely powerful because you can develop a structure organically. It's also potentially a little dangerous: there are no guard rails or training wheels. I spent eight months amassing over 3,000 notes. That is an impressive amount of writing, but you have to remember that there's no structure to anything. With 3,000 notes, finding anything is really difficult.
    So, if you're new to Roam, here is the issue: Roam's lack of structure isn't freedom to write without any structure, it's freedom to create your own.
    **What's Next**
    I learned a lot from my first Roam database and I'm excited to take that learning into my second database. This time, I've spent a lot of time thinking about how I want to structure my database and I've landed on a few rules:
    **Roam is for writing and thinking.** I see a lot of new users try to use Roam for their to do list and as a CRM. If that works for you, then great. I found that anything that wasn't related to my writing ultimately diluted my overall database. A better approach might be to use separate databases for this. But ultimately, you don't want to wade through your contacts to find an idea you need in your writing. So, now I only want notes that are related to my writing.
    **Notes need a purpose.** You should be able to answer questions like, "Why are you creating this page?" or "Why are you adding this note?" If you don't have a clear answer to that, then maybe it's not worth adding to your database.
    **Follow some Guidelines.** I need some process or set of guidelines for how I work with the notes in my database. I've settled on something like the Slipbox method, outlined in How to Take Smart Notes. But I need some process that will ultimately result in published pieces, like this one.
    These rules are mine. You can copy them, but think about how they fit into your own thinking before you do. 
    **My System for Writing in Roam**
    The system I use for writing in Roam is heavily based on the Slipbox Method, created by Niklas Luhmann and explained in-depth in the book How to Take Smart Notes. Luhmann's success with the slipbox system is pretty astounding: over the course of his career, he wrote 70 books and almost 400 peer reviewed scholarly articles, all by following this simple system.
    The original system of writing and note-taking is outlined in-depth in How to Take Smart Notes, which I highly recommend reading. I've read from cover-to-cover twice this year while almost always keeping it on my desk for reference.
    The system I've developed deviates from the Slipbox in a couple of notable ways. These deviations are adaptations of the system to Roam. In the original slipbox, everything was written on an index card where space was limited. In Roam, there isn't a similar limit to the length of pages. You can enforce that limit, but removing that limit gives us the opportunity to simplify the system further.
    **Creating Reference Notes**
    ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fzkfslipbox%2FhtH-mSlwAb.png?alt=media&token=175a441d-e045-4662-bf83-0d0eecea3911)
    Everything starts with taking notes on what you read. You can do this however you want, whether that's with a pen in the margin of a physical book or highlighting passages on your kindle or phone. The point is that you have to take note of what you read.
    What should you take notes on? That's up to you. What is interesting? What is an idea that you would like to remember? What concept or story makes you think? Ultimately, you're taking note of things that you would like to use in your writing.
    I take highlight anything that I think I will at some point like to use in my writing.
    These highlights get collected in a reference note. In the original system, the reference notes were solely for storing the reference information for a work. In my system, I use them for the reference information __and__ the highlights or notes I took on the source as I read it.
    Each reference note gets it's own page, which I populate with an Alfred snippet:
    **Insert an image of a reference note here**
    These reference notes get tagged to two important pages: Reference Notes and Inbox. One of the biggest conclusions I've made from my original database is that the highlights and notes you make from a book or article are completely useless if you don't actively do something with them. On their own, in your database, all they do is take up space.
    So reference notes get saved in the Inbox until I've gone through them and created Literature Notes for them. 
    **Turning Reference Notes into Literature Notes**
    ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fzkfslipbox%2FcpOM5Rcq2k.png?alt=media&token=11cbb470-d632-400d-b86e-fd56e1314cdd)
    Step 2 is to turn the highlights in your reference notes into literature notes. I do this for topics and themes from the book. There are two important things to remember about literature notes: they have to be concisely written and in your own words.
    One reference or source should generate a couple of literature notes. For instance, I created close to 40 literature notes from How to Take Smart Notes. On average, an article will lead to 1-5 literature notes.
    It's also worth noting here that I create reference and literature notes for just about everything. There are probably 20-30 reference notes in my database for different pages of the Azure documentation. A project I'm working on right now has me working with a lot of new resources within Azure. So as I go about my day, I create reference notes for each page of the documentation I land on, which I then later turn into reference notes. I expect to start turning these into articles about these Azure services in the coming weeks.
    **Writing Articles**
    [ ] **Create literature notes to articles piece**
    When it comes time to write an article, I collect the relevant literature notes, create an outline, and then turn that outline into a draft. The process is typically very quick and painless. It's easy to identify where I need to fill in a hole in my outline with further reading and I can often outline an idea for an article immediately after coming up with it.
    That's the beauty of the Slipbox method: it makes it really easy to discover ideas and make interesting connections, all while also making it really easy to flush out those ideas. 
    **Conclusion**
    I've been experimenting with this system in Roam and it's been really great. I can always find something I feel like writing about or working on. While I haven't quite figured out how to reliably publish on a schedule, this system has made it really easy to get to articles that are publishable

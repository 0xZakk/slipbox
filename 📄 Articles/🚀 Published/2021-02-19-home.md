Hello,

My name is Zakk. I run an independent software consultancy aimed at helping clients leverage the latest technologies. I love working with companies of all sizes, which I like to phrase as: helping the small be mighty and the big be nimble.

The early stages of the information age have shown us that there are very few things that can accelerate your business strategy like technology.

We've seen some incredibles things as a result. A company can analyze its data and know a shopper is pregnant before she does (Target). Machine learning can be used to detect and prevent fraud (PayPal). And a group of friends can build a billion dollar app in a few years (Instagram).

I look forward to working with you. The possibilities are endless.

Sincerely,

**Zakk Fleischmann,**
Hawthorne Interactive
Founder & CEO

# Ender's Game and the Future of the Internet

## Locke and Demosthenes

Later in the book, while Ender is at battle school, his siblings, Peter and Valentine, take up pseudonyms and start to write anonymously on the nets. They publish something every day and soon build up a big following of people who listen to their ideas. With these audiences, they're able to sway politics.

The nets sounds like a global, distributed version of Reddit. It sounds a lot like the modern internet mixed with AOL. For instance, you need credits in order to access the nets, so Peter and Valentine write in exchange for credits. In many ways, this sounds like QAnon and related misinformation phenomena.

There are also multiple nets that someone could write to. The internet is currently fractured into communities and social networks, but it all happens on the same macro-network. A distributed solution with competing nets could look something like an Ethereum-based internet.

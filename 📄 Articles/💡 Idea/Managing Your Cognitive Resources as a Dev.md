**Managing your cognitive resources as a developer:**

One of the most important skills you can learn as a developer is how to manage your own cognitive resources. Coding requires managing your short-term memory and concentrating for long periods of time. It also requires bouncing between divergent, creative thinking, where you're coming up with multiple solutions to a particular problem, and convergent thinking, where you are executing on one of those solutions.

Time blocking, as it's normally implemented by knowledge workers, is a great way of ensuring that you have time set aside to work towards non-urgent, but important goals. It can serve that purpose for developers too, but it really shines as a tool for managing your cognitive resources.

If you do this on a schedule, using the template that I described above, you don't have to use up as much of your cognitive resources to block off big chunks of your day for uninterrupted deep work. You just follow the schedule you set at the beginning of the week.

You'll know this system is working for you when you don't have to think about what you should be working on right now or what you have to do next. None of your cognitive resources are wasted on what to do, because you're following along with the schedule on your calendar.

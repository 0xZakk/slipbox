# Dirty Hands and Data

Two Quotes:
* “In God we trust. All others must bring data”
* “The person with dirty hands is right”

Compare and contrast these two quotes.

They’re both mostly-true. They both also stand the potential to suffer from bias.

Data gives you a high level view of the terrain, but the map is not the territory!

Dirty hands gives you hands-on experience (literally), but you could be suffering from availability bias.

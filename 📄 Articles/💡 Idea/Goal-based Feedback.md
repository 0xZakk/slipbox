# Goal-based Feedback

Idea came from reading an email by Erik Kennedy that I saved into the Links notebook.

Idea for a blog post is to apply this idea of goal-based feedback to technical people. It’s important when managing technical people to not make them feel like you’re encroaching on their area of expertise. Moreover, you want to provide feedback that will excite them!

Rather than tell them what to do, give them feedback on the goal they’re not meeting. (i.e. “Performance is a really big goal of ours and this code is (some performance goal they’re not meeting)”)

        - `every()`
            - Revisit the `concat` method = #[[ðŸ“¦ Article: Array Methods: concat]]
            - We want to make sure every item passed in is an array
            - ```javascript
function concat(...args) {
  let areArrays = args.every(arg => Array.isArray(arg))
  if (!areArrays) return
  
  // Rest of code
}```

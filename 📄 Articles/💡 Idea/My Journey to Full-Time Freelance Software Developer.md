## Introduction

- I started freelancing for two reasons: I needed the income and I needed the experience. I started right after I graduated from a coding bootcamp. Between the time I graduated and the time I got my first paycheck, I needed some way to cover my rent. Also, being a recent bootcamp grad, I needed some "professional" experience I could show employers. Freelancing ended up being a great solution for both of these.
- In the five years since I first started, I've never not done freelance work on the side. As a junior developer, it was a fantastic way to build up more experience. I really mastered JavaScript and Sass working on the freelance websites I built for people in the evenings and weekends. As I became more senior as a developer, it was always a really great way to earn some extra side income. For instance, my wife and I were able to afford the down payment on our apartment mostly from money I'd made freelancing on the side.
- If freelancing is something you're interested in, the thing you'll have to figure out is how to get your first paying client. This is a question I get asked a lot by people who are interested in pursuing freelance work, whether that be on the side or full-time.

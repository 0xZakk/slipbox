# Diffuse and Focused Collaborative Time

Ref to A Mind for Numbers and Focused and Diffuse thinking.

At conferences and summits, thereâ€™s a lot of focus on Focused mode collaboration (i.e. workshops and sessions) and not enough on Diffuse mode collaboration.

Focused collaboration: in a working session, going through an activity.

Diffuse collaboration: post-processing and thinking through what you just experienced. _This is where serendipity happens._

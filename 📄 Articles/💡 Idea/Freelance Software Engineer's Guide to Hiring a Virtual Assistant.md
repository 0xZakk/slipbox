- **Notes:**
- Having them manage a CRM
    - As a freelance engineer, I often need to bring someone in to pinch hit for a project or to delegate specific tasks in a project so that I can complete it on time.
    - The VA could manage the CRM and be the person to identify a few key people who I can reach out to (and even do the reaching out on my behalf)
- Second pair of eyes
    - If they're attending every meeting and taking good notes, you can have a second pair of eyes ensuring that nothing is going to get dropped or overlooked.
    - You can use this to take on more or you can use it to take on more work or you can use it to sleep better at night

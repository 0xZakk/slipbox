# How I Read

This is an overview and examination of the process I use to read books. It’s a hybrid of many, many others as well as the result of a lot of personal exploration.

## Everything Digital

I read all books on my Kindle and all articles in Instapaper. That let’s me highlight and use Readwise to source the highlights. These highlights then go in to Roam Research.

## Gardening Knowledge

This is a sort of variation on Progressive Summarization. I really like the idea of gardening as a metaphor for knowledge management. I put every note or idea into Roam and find a place where it can grow. I then cultivate these ideas and watch them become blog posts, guides, or books. By breaking up notes and ideas, I have a way of tracing where I got them while being able to treat them individually.

Sometimes I have a sense of how an idea will grow (i.e. this will grow into a great blog post while this other idea will grow into a great book). But sometimes I’m surprised by how much depth (or how little) there is to an idea.f

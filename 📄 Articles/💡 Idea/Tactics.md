Tactic: something small and low-effort that compounds

Next move, trying to optimize for idleness

Want to work (paid) as little as possible

Low, consistent commitment with compounding

People think of having a dog as being a big responsibility. Actually, it's only a little bit of responsibility with high degree of consistency. The responsibilities of wining a dog are:

* Feed it 1-2x per day
* Fill water bowl 1-2x per day
* Walk it 2-4x per day
* Take it to the vet 1-2x per year

In sum, these commitments are actually quite small and none of them require a lot of effort on your part. However, you can't miss any of these. I have to take Sadie out at 6am everyday no matter what - no matter how much or how well I slept. I have to feed her in the morning. Etc.

What are things that I can do that fit this model of low but consistent commitment?

* Writing
* Podcasting
* Tweeting
* Studying

Best way to accomplish something really big, is to find a way to make it really low-effort and then do it consistently for a long time

Next steps:
- Come up with small things you can do every day (tweet 3x per day, send 5 sales emails per day)

- **Notes:**
	- Learning from books
		- Follow a Zettelkasten method - __describe this__
	- Reviewing code and CodeWars
		- Review a challenge, review the code for a few of the sample applications and describe how each one works
		- Then solve the challenge myself
	- Create projects
		- Roam is the medium of learning, thinking, and writing - but there has to be some output
		- For me that was:
			- Solved challenges on CodeWars
			- Articles and vlogs teaching people what I had learned about Go
			- A technical review for the book Go in Action

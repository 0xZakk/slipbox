# Why Linear Systems Fail 

Why Agencies Fail?
Why Bootcamps Fail?
Why Linear Systems Fail - a Theory of Constraints

## General Assembly

Admissions (Sales) --> Instruction --> Job Placement (Outcomes)

Admissions: main incentive is to admit as many students as possible
Instruction: graduate as many of the incoming students
Outcomes: place students in jobs

Control over entry is highest in Admissions and lowest (0) in Job Placement / Outcomes

While all steps in the process have to be delivered, only one "produces revenue" for the business. This creates an incentive for the system maintainers to prioritize the first step in the system over the performance of the whole system (i.e. local v. global optimizations)

## Agencies

Most agencies work this way too

Sales / Accounts --> Design --> Development

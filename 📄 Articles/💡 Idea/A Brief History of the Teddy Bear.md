Outline:

- My teddy bear, Big Bear
- Named after Theodore "Teddy" Roosevelt
- Teddy's vacation - after being hit by a train and mediating the worst labor dispute of the time (coal miners (labor) v Baer (capital))
- Refused to shoot the bar as unsportsmanlike
- Race component - the bear was drawn to be very black and his captor as very white - Teddy's hunting assistant (Holt Collier) was actually a freed slave and former Confederate cavalryman \* Teddy was first president to welcome a black man into the White House (Booker T Washington)

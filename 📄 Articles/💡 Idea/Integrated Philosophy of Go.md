## Exporting Functions from a Package
- Exporting in JavaScript
	- `export`, `export default`, and `module.exports`
	- Whichever you go with, you have to be explicit in your code about your intent to make something available outside of this scope
- Exporting in Python
	- You can import anything from a file
	- Can you exclude something from being exported?
- Exporting in Go
	- Make the function name start with an upper case letter
		- Syntactically explicit rather than an explicit part of your code

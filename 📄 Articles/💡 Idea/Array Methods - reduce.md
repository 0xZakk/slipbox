        - Think about `map`. `reduce` is just a slightly modified version of `map`.
        - `map` takes an array and a function and returns a new array. The empty array that gets populated and returned is effectively a starting value. `reduce` lets you pick the starting value. It can be an array, an object, a number, or a boolean value.

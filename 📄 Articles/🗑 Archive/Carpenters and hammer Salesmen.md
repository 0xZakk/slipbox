## Outline

-   **Introduction: Teachers v Evangalists**
-   As the number of online, cohort-based courses continues to skyrocket, I thought I'd share a mental model that I've developed that helps me answer the question, "Who's course should I take?"
-   I call it Carpenters and Hammer Salesmen
-   **Background: Teaching a Cohort-based Course**
-   In my last job, I managed a team delivering a cohort-based course for 3 years. This was before they were called that and before they were as cool as they are today.
-   I managed the Software Engineering Immersive course for General Assembly in Washington, DC. While it was for a large company, my role was effectively the leader of the course in my market. I hired and managed instructors, worked with them to make decisions on the curriculum, and delivered the best education in Software Engineering out there.
-   We worked with roughly 200 students every year on the DC campus.
-   While a lot of things from this experience are relevant when it comes to picking a cohort-based course, the most relevant was hiring instructors. In my time at GA, I managed 12 different instructors, hiring most of them. I quickly learned to spot the good ones and the less good ones.
-   **The Difference**
-   The good ones were craftspeople, infinitely curious about their domain. They saw teaching as a brief detour from their craft, a means to share what they knew and deepen the love of their craft.
-   They were carpenters, happy to teach anything, provided it made sense, and focused on making beautiful furniture and molding more people into carpenters.
-   The less good instructors were evangelists. They wanted to teach a very specific set of things that they knew well and honestly believed were the best tools for any job. It didn't matter what technologies were in-demand and would get our students jobs. It mattered what they thought was the best.
-   They sold hammers. They couldn't teach you the nuance and complexity of crafting something because they didn't know how. More importantly, they themselves didn't care to learn.
-   How does this relate to the increasing crop of new cohort-based courses people are launching?
-   Well, not all of these courses will be good. And price and popularity are not good indicators at all. The way to spot the ones that will be good is to look for carpenters. And the easiest way to spot a carpenter is to think about what they're known for.
-   **David Perell and Tiago Forte**
-   Both David Perell and Tiago Forte teach wildly successful courses, but one is a whole lot better and more valuable than the other (I've taken both).
-   David Perell is a writer: he writes _a lot_. He publishes multiple essays of different lengths every week, a few longer-articles every month, two newsletters, and at least one short-book-length article every year. He is first and foremost a prolific writer. He happens to teach a course on writing.
-   What does Tiago Forte do?
-   He teaches a course on productivity and knowledge management.
-   What is he productive at?
-   ... teaching a productivity course ...
-   I do not mean to knock Tiago or his course. A lot of people have found it really valuable. I took it and it was fine.
-   But it was just fine.

	-   **Why I haven't built a course on Zettelkasten**
	-   I could develop and sell a course on building a Zettelkasten, but I don't want to do this because I want to be a carpenter, not a hammer salesman.
	-   A hammer salesman has one goal: to sell you hammers. He (hopefully) knows how to use them. But that is his ultimate goal. The carpenter, on the other hand, is trying to sell you the product of his work. He uses hammers to build his products. But he sells you the outputs, not the tools.
	-   Difference between: "In a gold rush, sell pick axes"
		-   Both of these things can be true
		-   You don't _make_ gold, you do make pick axes
		-   This quote makes sense when you're trying to capitalize on a trend
		-   It doesn't make sense if you're trying to build a legacy. In fact, following trends, whether that's to dig for gold or to sell pick axes to miners, doesn't make sense if you're trying to build a legacy
	-   David Perell is a writer who teaches a class on writing. Tiago Forte teaches a productivity course. But what is he productive at? Teaching (and selling) a productivity course. Tiago sells hammer. David is a carpenter.
	-   The ironic thing is, who would you rather learn from, the carpenter or the hammer salesman?

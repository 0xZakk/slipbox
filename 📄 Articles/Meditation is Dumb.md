# Meditation is Dumb

As you can probably guess from the title, I don't meditate. I think it's dumb. As meditation practice, or at least virtue signaling about it, has become more popular, I've resisted the temptation to call it out. So I just want to point a couple of things out.

## Avoid Marketing Based on Fundamental Flaws

Meditation reeks of your typical in-vogue self-help fad. Remember yoga? Do people still do that? Self-help yoga people were insufferable a few years ago. There was so much posturing about what kind of yoga you did and how much it "cleared your mind." Meditation is just the new that. 

To be fair, meditation never had a chance with me because, like so many things in the self-help world, it's based on the premise that the way your brain works is flawed and this supplemental thing will fix it.

For example: your food doesn't have enough vitamins, so you have to pay $30 a month to get vitamins. No, someone is trying to sell you something and you should just eat better food. 

## Find Better Ways to Manage Your Brain

Even if meditation does work, I can't believe. 

Maybe there really are people out there who's minds can be smoothly caressed into a gentle submission, but not mine. Mine needs to have the shit kicked out of it. My brain needs to be punched in the face and to have it's teeth kicked in before being told to shut the fuck up.

Meditation is also fundamentally about decreasing the power of your brain, not working with it. Don't try to change the way our mind works, learn to work with it.

# What Problem Does Blockchain Solve?

## Introduction

You've no doubt heard of blockchain, but you probably haven't heard a good answer to what it is or, for that matter, what it's good for. In this two-part series of articles, I'd like to provide my answer to both questions:

1. Why do we need blockchain?
1. What is a blockchain?

Another way of framing these questions might be, What problem does it solve and how does it solve that problem? Because in the media frenzy around the price of Bitcoin, hackers, money-launderers, and NFTs it can be lost that this new technology that does in fact solve a real problem.

My hope with this series is that you will understand what a blockchain is and how it works. But really, I want you to see blockchain as the logical next step in the exchange of value in the global economy.

That's a big goal, so let's get started.

## The History of Accounting

The history of accounting is really the history of the placement of trust. During major inflection points in economic activity, new mechanisms are created that shift how and where people place their trust so that economic activity can continue. 

### Early Trade

It's easy to trade when a group is small. Think of your friends and family: you keep track of who owes who what (whether that's a drink at happy hour or help moving) without an advanced system of record. The same was true of early exchange. You can easily keep track of who lent who what in a small tribe and you can do it all without the need for record keeping or strict enforcement. You exchange with someone else because you can trust them directly and, as a fail safe, trust the rest of your community to apply pressure in case of a default.

### Record Keeping

At some point, the size of the community hits an inflection point and you can't intimately know all of your trading partners. When this happens, your community needs a way for everyone to keep track of who traded with who. This is how (and why) early record keeping systems were developed and what lead to the birth of both writing and arithmetic: the birth of commerce.

In early bookkeeping systems, someone recorded transactions on tablets or, eventually, on papyrus. We placed our trust in the record keeper to honestly track the exchange of goods.

### Double-entry Book Keeping

A single record-keeper works when that record-keeper is trustworthy and manipulating the records is difficult. It's hard to go back and edit a stone tablet and, for a while, the amount of exchange is small enough that someone would likely get caught anyway. But as exchange between parties continues to increase, it grows beyond the capabilities of this simple record keeping.

If a record of what is sold is kept in Venice, it's really down to the Merchant's trustworthiness when they bring the goods to Rome. In order for exchange to grow further, something new is necessary. Enter double-entry book keeping. Two identical records are kept up to date. If they're ever out of sync, you know someone is lying. Our trust shifted from the bookkeeper to the system of bookkeeping.

### Trading Online

The most recent major upheaval in economic activity was of course the internet. It introduced new ways to exchange goods and greatly increased the amount of exchange. This has come with a number of economic benefits, but also it's own set of challenges.

- The internet introduced a bunch of new ways to exchange goods and greatly increased the amount of exchange happening
- In the physical world, reproducing goods requires labor and resources; in the digital world, goods can be reproduced easily and infinitely.
	- This is what has to the information revolution
	- The internet has thus far been based on information
	- A future internet will be based on value
- Double spend problem
	- Sending information around the internet by copying it works great. What about sending money?
	- When someone sends you money online, it's really important that their bank account doesn't have that money anymore (this is known as the double spend problem)
	- Early internet-native solutions to this couldn't find a solution, so centralized institutions stepped in
- Once again, we hit an inflection point where the old system didn't really work with the new system
- We place our trust in centralized authorities

- There were early attempts at Triple-entry Book Keeping:
	- The third bookkeeper was some software that actually kept records of all the edits and updates to the original two books, so you would have an audit trail of all changes made

## Why Do We Need it?

- We're at another inflection point in the history of exchange where the old system isn't working anymore - the volume of exchange is too high while the pace of exchange is too fast. That makes it easy for a whole host of bad actors to operate.
	- Lehman Brothers can report **XXX** in profit only to declare bankruptcy a few months later. Why? They were lying and there wasn't a way for you or anyone to know until it was too late.
	- Major institutions get hacked so often that you and I can both be sure that our personal, private information is out there. Don't believe me? I promise you, you have been pwnd (had your information hacked and stolen from somewhere). [You can check here.](https://haveibeenpwned.com/).
- There's a fundamental law of the internet, which is that things don't happen linearly, they happen exponentially. Given that, why incrementally increase the number of book keepers, when you can have n entry book keeping?
- In it's simplest form, that is what a blockchain does: n-entry bookkeeping where n is the number of participants in the system of exchange.

## What's the solution?

So how do you exchange goods and services online in this new era?

For most things, the answer is blockchain.

Because blockchain is effectively n-entry bookkeeping supported by advanced cryptography, it's effectively immutable and unhackable. It's an internet-native solution to the placement of trust problem. The next article in this 2-part series will breakdown how blockchains work and how, specifically, they solve this problem.

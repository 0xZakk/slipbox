# Thread - Internet of Information v Internet of Value

- The current version of the internet is based on the exchange of information. Originally envisioned as a way for scientists and researchers to share data and academic papers across multiple research institutions, the internet is, it's core about sharing information.
- It would be obvious to say that the internet has exploded in use - it's now as common-place a technology as the alphabet. But what has to be said is the way we've grown to use the internet. The underlying infrastructure of the internet is designed for sharing information, yet we've grafted most of society's square functions through these round tubes.
- We've found ways to, for instance, wire transfer money "through the internet," but it requires a lot of internal and external infrastructure to make this possible.
- This is where blockchain comes in.

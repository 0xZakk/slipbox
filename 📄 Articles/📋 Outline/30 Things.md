# 30 Things

- Armed with a copy of The Defining Decade, I set out to get a JD and an MS in Computer Science, start and sell 3 companies, drive a Porsche, and become fluent in all 7 official languages of the UN (those were actual goals I wrote down). At 28, I have neither a JD, nor an MS. I occasionally drive my wife’s Toyota Corolla and my stomach churns at the thought of spending more on a car. On top of it all, I can barely converse with my extended family in their native Spanish.
- I’ll be the first to admit that the journey through my 20s was more akin to a bumper car or a pinball than anything else.
- The journey through my 20s has had many high highs and just as many low lows. I got married. I adopted a dog. I found a career I love and a job that gives me meaning. I also almost went broke. I let a job turn me into someone I hated. And on 2 occasions, called the national suicide prevention hotline.
- The remedy for a terrible day is kindness and generosity towards others. Those days where you want to call it at 9:00am and just go home. The ones where you want to throw your laptop across the room. I’ve tried a hundred other things and not one worked, but this. Not drinking, nor throwing a fit, nor drowning out the world with your favorite record. Bitterness, revenge and xxx have never worked either.
- Go to every wedding you can.
- It takes a “yes”. Nothing amazing and life changing ever happened from saying “No”. You have to say yes to have an amazing experience.
- Related: be careful of silent No’s, what are you saying no to without maybe realizing that’s what you’re doing
- Don’t let someone say No for you.
- There are no silver billets 
- Life goes on. 
- Some of the things you struggle with, you will struggle with for the rest of your life. If you were to tell me this at 20, I would scoff and describe the indertiminable power of will. At 28, I believe you can, and should, accept the ways you are imperfect. In a way, it’s beautiful. And with practice, I think you can even grow to love your imperfections.

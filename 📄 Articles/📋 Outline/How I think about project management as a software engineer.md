# How I think about project management as a software engineer

A small change in thinking that has helped me be more productive is to think in terms or domains, projects, and tasks, rather than just projects and tasks.

What we typically think of as a project is too big to reason about. So instead, I define it as a domain, or a collection of projects.

In my work, a domain is something like build a web application.

You can't sit down and think through everything you'll need to do to build a project of that size. Trying to do so is setting yourself up for stress and anxiety and no one wants that.

So now a domain can be some collection of work with a definite (or semi-definite) end state, composed of some unknown number of projects.

All that means that you know when the project is finished, you just don't know everything you'll need to do to finish it. 

You don't know because you can't know - more on that in a bit.
I try to define a project as something that

- can be completed in under 6 hours 
- finished in 1 or 2 sittings
- that I can roughly think through from start to finish

The first two requirements are about scope - projects should be small and focused. In my system, a project is probably closer to what many people would think of as a task.

The last requirement is the most important. You want to be able to pseudo-code the entire project. If you can't, then it's too big in scope.

What helped me think about this is learning about embodied experience: expertise is really about application of the right work strategies at the right time, rather than linearly following a plan. Call it expert's intuition.

Project management is often about creating a plan and trying to follow it. But the assumption there is that your work is linear and forecast-able, neither of which is true.

You can't sit down and plan out everything you need to do to build a web application (or whatever your project is) because it's not a linear process and you can't predict everything you'll need to do (there are too many unknowns and you're forced to make too many assumptions).

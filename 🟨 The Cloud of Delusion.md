The Cloud of Delusion is the state of a man who has given away his [[ðŸŸ¨ What is Sovereignty | Sovereignty]].

Men fabricate a story that makes them a victim to other people. They blame others for their problems and construct an understanding of reality where nothing is their fault. When men do this, there's also nothing they can do about the situation their in. It's happening to them.

This is what it means to live in the Cloud of Delusion. 

The result is that men feel powerless to do anything about their situation. By blaming others (their clients or the economy for their lackluster business, their wife for the state of their relationship, etc) all they can do is wait.

In order to lift the Cloud of Delusion, a man must take ownership. It's better to over-correct on owning the situation that you're in. Regardless of what's going on with the economy, it's your fault that your business isn't doing well. Regardless of what your wife says or does, it's your fault your marriage sucks. When you stop blaming other people and start to focus on yourself, you regain the power to do something about these situations.

You can't accomplish something meaningful without a clear vision of what it is you want to accomplish. How will you measure your behaviors and outcomes without it?

Most men have some vision for how they want their life to be. Very few men actually succeed in making that vision a reality. While there are a lot of factors that play into this, one is that most don't articulate what that vision is.

The first step in recapturing your Sovereignty is to spend a lot of serious time thinking about what you want your life to look like. You are not entitled a unique vision for your life -- you have to earn it. And the way to earn it is to spend time reflecting on where your life is now and where you want it to be. You're ultimately developing and learning a new operating system, which takes time and effort.

## Four Exercises

To get you started on crafting your own unique vision, [[ðŸŸ¦ Sovereignty, The Battle for the Hearts and Minds of Men]] has the following four exercises that you should work through.

### The Pull

When were you most satisfied?

Take inventory of your life and think of the times you've been the most satisfied, the most content, and the most fulfilled. These things are going to pull you towards becoming a Sovereign Man and the life you want.

What do you see when you look at your relationships, your business, your community, your health, and your life?

### The Push

When were you least satisfied?

Now take inventory of your life and consider the most negative experiences. These are the things that are going to drive you away from the life you have now force you to do something different.

What do you see that you do not wish to experience again in your life?

### What Kind of Man?

In order to achieve the pulling and avoid the pushing vision, you're going to have to become a new man. It's been said that if you want something you've never had, you have to do something you've never done. It's also true that you have to become something you've never been.

What kind of man will you need to become in order to turn the vision you've articulated into a reality?

### Write Your Own Eulogy

Write your own eulogy as a way to to think about how you want people to remember you, not as you currently are, but for the way you wish to become.

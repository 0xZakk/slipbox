- retrospectively it's difficult not to be disappointed, to feel that computers have not yet been nearly as transformative as far older tools for thought, such as language and writing.
- mnemonic medium
- why is it that the technology industry has made comparatively little effort developing this vision of transformative tools for thought?
- Ivan Sutherland, Seymour Papert, Vannevar Bush,
- And so a theme through both parts of the essay is to identify powerful ideas that weren't formerly known or weren't acted upon. Out of this understanding arises a conviction that a remarkable set of opportunities is open today.
- in Alan Kay, User Interface: A Personal View (1989), among other places. that a more powerful aim is to develop a new medium for thought. A medium such as, say, Adobe Illustrator is essentially different from any of the individual tools Illustrator contains. Such a medium creates a powerful immersive context, a context in which the user can have new kinds of thought, thoughts that were formerly impossible for them.
- In a similar way, there's an inherent inadequacy in writing about tools for thought. To the extent that such a tool succeeds, it expands your thinking beyond what can be achieved using existing tools, including writing. The more transformative the tool, the larger the gap that is opened. Conversely, the larger the gap, the more difficult the new tool is to evoke in writing. But what writing can do, and the reason we wrote this essay, is act as a bootstrap. It's a way of identifying points of leverage that may help develop new tools for thought. So let's get on with it.
- What makes these subjects difficult? In fact, individually many of the underlying ideas are not too complicated for people with a technical background. But the ideas come in an overwhelming number, a tsunami of unfamiliar concepts and notation. People must learn in rapid succession of qubits, the bra-ket notation, Hadamard gates, controlled-not gates, and many, many other abstract, unfamiliar notions. They're imbibing an entire new language. Even if they can follow at first, understanding later ideas requires fluency with all the earlier ideas. It's overwhelming and eventually disheartening.
- Aspirationally, the mnemonic medium makes it almost effortless for users to remember what they read.
- Is it possible to design a new medium which much more actively supports memorization? That is, the medium would build in (and, ideally, make almost effortless) the key steps involved in memory. If we could do this, then instead of memory being a haphazard event, subject to chance, the mnemonic medium would make memory into a choice.
- mnemonic essays (i.e., particular instances of the mnemonic medium).
- By a card's “demonstrated retention” we mean the maximum time between a successful review of that card, and the prior review of that card.
- This is the big, counterintuitive advantage of spaced repetition: you get exponential returns for increased effort.
- The mnemonic medium is much more like meditation
- the benefits are delayed, and hard to have any immediate sense of. Indeed, with the mnemonic medium, the greater the delay, the more the benefit.
- Six months after release of the prototype, 195 users had demonstrated one full month of retention on at least 80% of cards in the essay, demonstrating an extraordinary level of commitment to the process
- It turns out that flashcards are dramatically under-appreciated, and it's possible to go much, much further in developing the mnemonic medium than is a priori obvious.
- Quantum Country is an example of a memory system. That is, it's a system designed to help users easily consolidate what they've learned into long-term memory.
- declarative knowledge – lists of American Presidents, capitals of countries, and so on.
    - **Note:** Knowledge of basic facts - i.e. Knowing information (but not understanding)
- In fact, memory systems can be extraordinarily helpful for mastering abstract, conceptual knowledge, the kind of knowledge required to learn subjects such as quantum mechanics and quantum computing. This is achieved in part through many detailed strategies for constructing cards capable of encoding this kind of understanding.
- it's possible because of the way the mnemonic medium embeds spaced repetition inside a narrative. That narrative embedding makes it possible for context and understanding to build in ways difficult in other memory systems.
- However, employing those strategies requires considerable skill. In practice, that skill barrier has meant these strategies are used by no more than a tiny handful of people. By contrast, in Quantum Country an expert writes the cards, an expert who is skilled not only in the subject matter of the essay, but also in strategies which can be used to encode abstract, conceptual knowledge. And so Quantum Country provides a much more scalable approach to using memory systems to do abstract, conceptual learning.
- In some sense, Quantum Country aims to expand the range of subjects users can comprehend at all.
- More generally, we believe memory systems are a far richer space than has previously been realized. Existing memory systems barely scratch the surface of what is possible.
- memory practice,
    - **Note:** Daily review and repition
- memory systems are a small part of a much bigger picture.
- cards are fundamental building blocks of the mnemonic medium, and card-writing is better thought of as an open-ended skill. Do it poorly, and the mnemonic medium works poorly. Do it superbly well, and the mnemonic medium can work very well indeed.
- Note that these are just three of many more principles – a more detailed discussion of good principles of card construction may be found in Augmenting Long-term Memory.
- Most questions and answers should be atomic:
    - **Note:** Atomic questions are easier to memorize correctly
      bad:
      what is the django command to create a new app?
      good:
      what is the django-admin subcommand for creating new app?
- Make sure the early questions in a mnemonic essay are trivial: it helps many users realize they aren't paying enough attention as they read:
- Avoid orphan cards:
    - **Note:** Orphan cards are those that arent connected to other pieces of knowledge
- we want to emphasize this point, since it's common for people to have the simplistic model “good memory system = spaced repetition”. That's false, and an actively unhelpful way of thinking.
- How can we ensure users don't just learn surface features of questions?
    - **Note:** I.e. Identifying a question without reading it or engaging with it
- How to best help users when they forget the answer to a question?
    - **Note:** Ask a targeted follow up question rather than just bump a question down a level
- How to encode stories in the mnemonic medium?
    - **Note:** People have an easier time remembering stories
- One such idea is elaborative encoding. Roughly speaking, this is the idea that the richer the associations we have to a concept, the better we will remember it. As a consequence, we can improve our memory by enriching that network of associations.
- Provide questions and answers in multiple forms:
    - **Note:** Including images increases recal (i.e)
- verbal and non-verbal information are stored separately in long-term memory. Paivio and others investigated the picture superiority effect, demonstrating that pictures and words together are often recalled substantially better than words alone.
- Vary the context: In
    - **Note:** Review in different locations and under different circumstances
- studying material in two different places, instead of twice in the same place, provided a 40% improvement in later recall.
- varying the context of review promotes memory.
- How do the cards interact with one another? What is the ideal network structure of knowledge?
    - **Note:** A set of cards exist in a network; thesy are related to each other. So what happen when we remove a card? Are there lynch pin cards?
- lynchpin cards?
- It's a way of using people's immensely powerful visual and spatial memories as a form of leverage for other types of memory
- One caution concerns the range of what can be memorized using mnemonic techniques
- the mnemonic techniques tend to be much better suited for concrete objects than abstract conceptual knowledge
- in general, an advantage of spaced repetition is that it works across a far broader range of knowledge than do any of the mnemonic techniques.
- The mnemonic techniques are, as you have likely realized, an example of elaborative encoding in action,
- By contrast, when an expert learns new information in their field, they don't make up artificial connections to their memory palace. Instead, they find meaningful connections to what they already know. Those connections are themselves useful expertise; they're building out a dense network of understanding.
- And so mnemonic techniques should be thought of as a useful tool to use in building powerful memory systems, especially when combined with ideas such as spaced repetition.
- People tend to fall into two buckets when told of the mnemonic medium. One group is fascinated by the idea, and wants to try it out. The second group is skeptical or even repulsed. In caricature, they say: “Why should I care about memory? I want deeper kinds of understanding! Can't I just look stuff up on the internet?
- memory was often a binding constraint in learning new fields See here and here for more on learning new fields using Anki.
- By largely automating away the problem of memory, the mnemonic medium makes it easier for people to spend more time focusing on other parts of learning, such as conceptual issues.
- It's in this phase that memory systems shine. They can accelerate people through the awkward early stages of learning a subject. Ideally, they'll support and enable work on creative projects.
- when master chess players look at a position in chess they don't see it in terms of the individual pieces, a rook here, a pawn there. Instead, over years of playing and analyzing games the players learn to recognize somewhere between 25,000 and 100,000 patterns of chess pieces. These much more elaborate “chunks” are combinations of pieces that the players perceive as a unity, and are able to reason about at a higher level of abstraction than the individual pieces.
- It seems plausible, though needs further study, that the mnemonic medium can help speed up the acquisition of such chunks, and so the acquisition of mastery.
- What we do believe is that many people's dislike of rote memorization has led them to a generalized dislike of memory, and consequently to underrate the role it plays in cognition. Memory is, in fact, a central part of cognition. But the right response to this is not immense amounts of dreary rote memorization. Rather, it's to use good tools and good judgment to memorize what truly matters.
- Memory systems don't make it easy to decide what to memorize:
- What's the real impact of the mnemonic medium on people's cognition? How does it change people's behavior?
- Furthermore, the user may not even recognize opportunities to use what they have learned. More broadly: memory is not an end-goal in itself. It's embedded in a larger context: things like creative problem-solving, problem-finding, and all the many ways there are of taking action in the world.
- In modern user interface terms, the numerals have the same affordances, despite their meaning being very different in the two cases.
- Our story about Hindu-Arabic numerals and mathematics is fanciful. But it expresses a general truth: the most powerful tools for thought express deep insights into the underlying subject matter. In the case of memory systems, this means they're not just “applied cognitive science”, a collage of existing ideas from cognitive science pasted together using modern design practice. Rather, they will express deep original insights into memory, insights no-one else in the world has ever had. A truly great memory system will be cognitive science of the highest order.
- The warning is this: conventional tech industry product practice will not produce deep enough subject matter insights to create transformative tools for thought.
- The aspiration is for any team serious about making transformative tools for thought. It's to create a culture that combines the best parts of modern product practice with the best parts of the (very different) modern research culture.
- It's tempting to overlook or undervalue this kind of emotional connection to a subject. But it's the foundation of all effective learning and of all effective action. And it is much easier to create such an emotional connection using video than using text.
- Is it possible to create a medium which blends the best qualities of both video and text?
- mnemonic video
- The broader point here is about taking emotion seriously. Historically, a lot of work on tools for thought has either ignored emotion, or treated it as no more than a secondary concern. Instead, that work has focused on new skills acquired, on what the user “learns”. They've been designing for Spock, when emotional connection is a high-order bit. Do users feel disinterested? Afraid? Hostile? Anxious? Or do they internalize a sense of excitement, of beauty, perhaps even an expansion in their own goals, an expansion of their self?
- At the same time, a positive emotional experience alone is not enough. For tools for thought to attain enduring power, the user must experience a real growth in mastery, an expansion in their ability to act. And so we'd like to take both the emotional and intellectual experience of tools for thought seriously.
- The work is really about exploration of an open-ended question: how can we develop tools that change and expand the range of thoughts human beings can think?
- Similarly, the invention of other tools for thought – writing, the printing press, and so on – are among our greatest ever breakthroughs. And, as far as we know, all emerged primarily out of open-ended exploration, not in a primarily goal-driven way.
- “What will new tools for thought be like?” is a question we hear often. And yet, almost by definition, we cannot say. As we noted earlier, if we could communicate the experience in an essay, then the tools would be failing at their job; they would not be transforming a person's thinking, or even their consciousness.
- The skill of writing is to create a context in which other people can think. — Edwin Schlossberg
- Peter Norvig has written an interactive essay discussing the distribution of wealth in society. Norvig's essay is a Jupyter notebook which expresses many of the ideas in running Python code.
    - **Tags:** #review
    - **Note:** .review
- Python
    - **Note:** Code is a tool for thought
- Norvig's essay is one of thousands (or perhaps even millions) of Jupyter notebooks that have been created. Of course, most such notebooks are hastily and poorly written. But in the hands of an excellent writer and thinker like Norvig, notebooks can become remarkable environments for thought, both individual and shared. It's tempting to regard them as merely a mashup of essay and code. But really they're a new media form, with different possibilities from either essays or code, and with striking opportunities to go much further.
- Seymour Papert, one of the principal creators of the Logo programming language, had a remarkable aspiration for Logo. Logo is sometimes described as a “programming language for children”, and people sometimes think Papert was mostly interested in helping children learn how to program. But that wasn't Papert's principal intent. Rather, Papert wanted to create an immersive environment – a kind of “Mathland” – in which children could be immersed in mathematical ideas. In essence, children could learn differential geometry by going to Mathland.
- It's to talk about the “floor” and “ceiling” of different environments for thought.
- There's a general principle here: good tools for thought arise mostly as a byproduct of doing original work on serious problems.
- Furthermore, the problems themselves are typically of intense personal interest to the problem-solvers. They're not working on the problem for a paycheck; they're working on it because they desperately want to know the answer.
- In serious mediums, there's a notion of canonical media. By this, we mean instances of the medium that expand its range, and set a new standard widely known amongst creators in that medium. For instance, Citizen Kane, The Godfather, and 2001 all expanded the range of film, and inspired later film makers.

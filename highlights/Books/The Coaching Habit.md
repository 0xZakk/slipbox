- Over the years, we’ve come to hold these truths to be self-evident: Coaching is simple. In fact, this book’s Seven Essential Questions give you most of what you need. You can coach someone in ten minutes or less. And in today’s busy world, you have to be able to coach in ten minutes or less. Coaching should be a daily, informal act, not an occasional, formal “It’s Coaching Time!” event. You can build a coaching habit, but only if you understand and use the proven mechanics of building and embedding new habits.
- When you build a coaching habit, you can more easily break out of three vicious circles that plague our workplaces: creating overdependence, getting overwhelmed and becoming disconnected.
- Circle #1: Creating Overdependence
- Building a coaching habit will help your team be more self-sufficient by increasing their autonomy and sense of mastery and by reducing your need to jump in, take over and become the bottleneck.
- Circle #2: Getting Overwhelmed
- Building a coaching habit will help you regain focus so you and your team can do the work that has real impact and so you can direct your time, energy and resources to solving the challenges that make a difference.
- Circle #3: Becoming Disconnected
- Building a coaching habit will help you and your team reconnect to the work that not only has impact but has meaning as well.
- “Deep Practice.” The three components of Deep Practice are: Practicing small chunks of the bigger action (for instance, rather than practice the whole tennis serve, you practice just tossing the ball up). Repetition, repetition and repetition… and repetition. Do it fast, do it slow, do it differently. But keep repeating the action. And finally, being mindful and noticing when it goes well. When it does, celebrate success. You don’t have to go buy the bottle of Möet, although you can if you wish. A small fist pump will do just fine.

- Stop offering up advice with a question mark attached. That doesn’t count as asking a question.
- When people start talking to you about the challenge at hand, what’s essential to remember is that what they’re laying out for you is rarely the actual problem. And when you start jumping in to fix things, things go off the rails in three ways: you work on the wrong problem; you do the work your team should be doing; and the work doesn’t get done.
- The Focus Question: What’s the Real Challenge Here for You?
- Proliferation of Challenges, Coaching the Ghost, and Abstractions & Generalizations.
- Resist the temptation to do the work and to pick one of the many challenges as the starting point (even though, no doubt, you’ll have an opinion on which one it should be). Instead, ask something like this: “If you had to pick one of these to focus on, which one here would be the real challenge for you?”
- Bring the focus back to the person you’re talking to. Acknowledge what’s going on, and ask the Focus Question. It will sound something like this: “I think I understand some of what’s going on with [insert name of the person or the situation]. What’s the real challenge here for you?”
- If you feel yourself drifting, you need to find a way to ground the challenge and connect it to the person you’re talking to. Just as with Coaching the Ghost, it’s about bringing the focus back to the person at hand. To do that, you’d ask something like this: “I have a sense of the overall challenge. What’s the real challenge here for you?”
- it’s the difference between the fire and the person who’s trying to put out the fire.
- Someone once said that everything tastes better with bacon. As a fallen vegetarian, I can attest to that. Equally, every question gets better when you add, “And what else?” Asking, “What’s the real challenge here for you?” Good. Adding, “And what else? What else is a real challenge here for you?” Even better.

- ## Introduction
- This is a book for people who need actionable advice. Instead of trying to convince you to build an audience, let me share the stories of those who have done it well and then equip you with the tools and strategies to build an audience-driven business.
- You will learn how to discover your future audience, how to embed yourself in your audience's communities, how to extract business opportunities through observation, and how to build a following that will grow your personal and professional brand.
- A common thread between these founders is their dedication to their audience. They put their audiences first: they listened to the people in communities they were members of, found problems they were excited to solve, and built a following while creating successful services and products. Instead of assuming they knew exactly what their future customers would need, they put their audience first, at all times. Whenever it came to a decision, they gathered feedback from their audiences — their peers — and ensured that the results would benefit their growing following of customers, prospects, and supporters. Paul, Rosie, and Ben are Embedded Entrepreneurs.
- In fact, this focus on people, where they congregate, and what they need deserves a better name altogether. I call it the "Audience-Driven approach" to building a business. A lot of this process takes place inside of communities; as places of exchange, learning, and teaching, they allow their members to build a reputation as valued contributors.
- At first, communities are hunting grounds for great opportunities, then they turn into places to build meaningful relationships, and later they'll be the fertile soil in which you will grow your business. At all points, the community members are a potential audience for what you have to say and what you offer.
- Founders that go "idea-first" often build businesses that are "solutions looking for a problem." The “idea-first” approach results in products that are lacking validation and are built without a clear audience in mind.
- The Audience-Driven approach turns all these uncertainties into advantages:
- Validation is built-in: you're constantly interacting with the people you want to serve and empower, which leads to much faster feedback loops. You get to experience their problems first-hand, you have access to real people with real struggles, and you can collaborate with your audience to build a solution that works for them.
- You aren't leaving much to chance: you know that there are real people out there feeling a painful problem, and you can check if they are already spending money attempting to solve it, thus increasing your chances of building something people are willing to pay for.
- You create a personal brand that transcends the business you're currently working on: even if your startup fails, you continue to be a domain expert in that field.
- ## The Audience-Driven Movement
- An audience used to be a group of people in front of a stage. The band would play their songs, and the audience would cheer. The lead singer would yell something at them, and the audience would applaud.
- An audience was a one-way-street. Times have changed.
- In a globally connected world full of creators, it's not enough to talk at people anymore. Today, successful entrepreneurs talk with their audience; they engage with them on a level that the business world has never seen before. Today, everyone is on stage.
- Founders understand that an audience is not a mere distribution channel but a fundamental component of their business's success.
- ### Audience-First
- What I want to focus on is a different way of involving your audience. I want to talk about a more immersive, "Audience-Driven" approach to business. Instead of just building a following, I want to focus on "putting the audience first," the public practice of engaging and interacting with the people you have chosen to empower from the very start.
- ### Audience
- That brings me to the term "audience." An audience is everyone who should be interested in you, your business, and your products.  They are not just walking wallets. An audience is a group of real people with desires, dreams, and problems.
- ### Community
- An audience is not the same as a community, but they are related. Communities are focal points of audiences and a big part of the day-to-day work of the Embedded Entrepreneur. However, audiences extend way beyond individual communities. They span a multitude of communities,
- A community looks in all kinds of directions, but an audience looks at you.
- ### The Audience-Driven Approach
- The Audience-Driven approach's core principle is simple: you delay defining “the idea” and your product until after you have chosen and explored an audience for your business — because you can’t know what your future customers need without understanding them first. You first choose a market to operate in, find a potential audience to serve, embed yourself within their communities, and learn what you need to create to solve their critical problems. Then, and only then, do you work on your idea — and create a following along the way.
- ### The Product-First Approach
- If the Audience-Driven approach lowers these risks, which alternative process has the highest risk of failure? That would be the product-first approach: the concept of coming up with a "really good idea" and assuming that you'll be able to figure out who you can sell it to at some later point.
- Why do so many founders go product-first and fail?
- I call this the "entrepreneurial curse": we founders assume too much. At its very core, we need to assume that things will work out fine to find the motivation to start a business. That's the healthy part. But we then take it too far. We assume that we know our market, who our audience is, and what they need.
- Here is a quick rundown of the approach that I will introduce in this book:
- Audience Discovery: Find your audience. The most important choice is who you want to serve. Deliberately selecting an audience is the foundation of a successful business. I will show you a tested and actionable five-step process to find the audience you want to empower.
- Audience Exploration & Problem Discovery: Understand the path. Building a business the audience-driven way requires you to be an active part of communities, which involves talking to people and learning from them. I will share strategies and tactics for how you can do this as effectively as possible.
- Audience-Building: Create (for) your audience. Working with and for your audience will allow you to build a product and a business that solves real problems for real people. By consistently showing up and providing value, you will become an expert that your audience will gladly follow. I will share the stories and approaches of the founders who have succeeded — and failed — to build their audience and businesses in public.
- # Audience Discovery
- ## An Actionable Guide to Finding Your Audience
- There are many fish in the sea, but never let a good one swim away. Matshona Dhliwayo
- Let me introduce you to a data-driven method of finding a potential audience for your side business. It will allow you to discover an audience that will sustain a business for many years and make it an enjoyable journey.
- Have you ever been to a museum only to be shoved through a gift shop on your way out? The gift shops are not the main attraction, yet they contribute significantly to those institutions' bottom lines1. But no entrepreneur in their right mind would open a museum gift shop in their garage and expect it to make a profit. A store stocked with art prints and interior design books needs a particular audience. Museums have understood that to sell art-related books to people, they need to put the store where their artsy audience already is: on their way out of an exhibition. Museums have understood a core rule of a successful business: find your audience first, then sell them something they need. They think "audience-driven."
- If museums have understood that, why do we still see so many founders creating solutions searching for a problem?
- It is like the infamous developer trope of testing things in production. You want to check if your code is working well before you deploy it to your customers. Why not do the same for your business?
- The best way to keep the amount of guesswork to a minimum is a "multi-stage validation" approach.
- First, explore which audiences you want to help. Select the audience you think is most likely to support your business endeavors. Validate: Make sure the audience is interesting for you, is the right size, has exciting problems, and is willing to pay for a solution.
- Then, observe that audience and detect their most critical problems. Select the most critical problem among them. Validate: Ensure the problem is genuinely critical, people are already looking for solutions, and it can't be easily ignored or delegated.
- Then, envision a solution that solves this problem within your audience's workflow. Validate: Make sure that your solution doesn't have unintended side-effects and solves their problem without adding additional work.
- Finally, and only now, think of the product. In which medium do you need to provide your solution? Will it be a mobile app? A SaaS application? A platform? Or will it have to be a technical solution at all? Now is the time for the "idea" and the "product."
- The goal of this process is to help you find that initial audience. Let's start with exploring which audience fits you best and make sure it can support a business.
- Start with an empty spreadsheet, putting "Audience Name" in the first column.
- ## Step 1: Awareness — Think of Possible Audiences
- The goal of this step is to find a group of people you want to help. It should be a well-defined group, best centered around a common interest or activity.
- An existing tribe will work best. Tribes consist of people who share an interest, are highly interconnected, and follow the same leaders. They make for wonderful niche audiences.
- Seth Godin uses a wonderful definition for tribes: “People like us do things like this.”
- Ask yourself:
- What tribes do you belong to?
- What hobbies do you have?
- What has been your lifestyle in the past?
- What professions do you have?
- What companies do you work for? Which companies are you a customer of?
- What is your significant other doing? What groups do they belong to that are different from your groups?
- What groups do your parents and siblings belong to?
- What are the social circles you frequent?
- The list you came up with from this exercise should contain a few dozen audiences.
- For each audience on this list, I either am an expert or have direct access to an expert in my friends and family circle. The full list I have collected over the last few years contains at least 300 different audiences. I bet you can come up with at least 100 distinct groups of people within a few hours.
- ### Exploring Your Surroundings
- ### Niches vs. Worldviews
- Amy Hoy of Stacking the Bricks stresses focusing on the opinions held within certain groups of people1. Niches define people by external factors, while worldviews are identity-related and internal.
- ## Step 2: Affinity — Find Out How Much You Care About Them
- With a list of possible audiences and niches, you now need to weed out the markets you don't care about enough.
- No business was ever successfully built by a founder who didn't care about the people they were selling their product to. You need to feel the desire to help your customers genuinely, or you will lose interest in providing value to them at some point.
- Add a new column to your spreadsheet, called "Affinity." For every row in your spreadsheet, you will need to produce a rating between 0 and 5. Zero means that you don't care about serving this audience at all, and 5 means that you want to devote your life to serving the people in that niche.
- ## Step 3: Opportunity — Find Out If They Have Interesting Problems
- For each audience, you will want to find out if they have any interesting problems. You’re not looking into finding their critical problem just yet, as you will only take a cursory view into your audience at this point, but be on the lookout nonetheless.
- For each audience, do the following things to find out if they have problems that might interest you.
- Find a few SaaS products in their space and see what problems they solve.
- Find a community forum or social media group where your niche audience hangs out and go through their recent posts.

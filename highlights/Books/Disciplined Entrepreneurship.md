- Each of these steps has rigorously evaluated whether a customer would benefit from your product, regardless of whether an analyst, potential investor, or technology writer standing on the sidelines can see the value. As someone once said to me, “In concept, concept and reality are the same, but in reality, concept and reality are not the same at all.”
- “In concept, concept and reality are the same, but in reality, concept and reality are not the same at all.”
- This book also provides a common language to discuss key aspects of venture creation so that you can more effectively discuss your new venture with advisors, mentors, and fellow entrepreneurs.
- Bill Gates, Larry Ellison, and all the other highly visible entrepreneurs, they seem to be different from us. They seem extraordinary. But each of their successes is a result of great products that made them successful, not some special gene.
- To be a successful entrepreneur, you must have great and innovative products. Products can be physical goods, but also services or the delivery of information. All the other factors that influence success are nothing without a product. And the process of making a great product can be taught.
- Three Common Myths That Must Go There are many misconceptions about what entrepreneurship is and what is required to be an entrepreneur. The first myth is that individuals start companies. While the entrepreneur as a lone hero is a common narrative, a close reading of the research tells a different story. Teams start companies. Importantly, a bigger team actually adds to the odds of success. More founders = better odds of success.1 The second myth is that all entrepreneurs are charismatic and that their charisma is a key factor in success. In fact, while charisma may be effective for a short period, it is difficult to sustain. Instead, research shows that more important than being charismatic, entrepreneurs need to be effective communicators, recruiters, and salespeople. The third myth is that there is an entrepreneurship gene, that certain people are genetically predisposed for success in starting companies. As the cartoon at the beginning of this chapter suggests, such a physical gene has not and will not be found. Some believe personality traits like flamboyance or boldness are correlated with successful entrepreneurship, but that line of thought is misguided. Instead, there are real skills that increase the odds of success, such as people management, sales skills, and the topic of this book, product conception and delivery. These skills can be taught. They are not genetically gifted to a few lucky souls. People can adapt and learn new behaviors, and entrepreneurship therefore can be broken down into discrete behaviors and processes that can be taught.

- The real reason why MIT is so successful at creating new companies is a combination of spirit and skills. At MIT there is a culture that encourages people to start companies all the time and everywhere, much like in Silicon Valley, Israel, Tech City in London, and Berlin today. Role models are everywhere, and they are not abstract icons, but rather very real people no different from you. An aura of possibility and collaboration so pervades the very air at MIT that students quickly adopt the mindset that “yes, I can start a company too.” They become infected with the “entrepreneurial virus,” believing in the benefits of launching a new venture.
- small and medium enterprise entrepreneurship (SME).
- Innovation-driven enterprise (IDE) entrepreneurship
- Innovation = Invention ∗ Commercialization
- These examples show that the capability to commercialize an invention is necessary for real innovation.
- An entrepreneur, then,
- serves primarily as the commercialization agent.
- Innovation can come in many varieties including technology, process, business model, positioning, and more.

### Highlights

**Technology**
- The monitor - A device that gets implanted at the base of the spine. Records through eyes.
- Desks - iPad like devices
- Table - computer-like table that lets you interact with it (ie read the news)
- Locke and Demosthenes - Peter and Valentine write anonymously on something like a global, distributed Reddit where they develop a really large following and try to sway elections and public discourse.
- Flight Simulators and Space Drones - they think they're in a flight simulator, simulating battles in deep space. In the end, they're operating space drones where the ship is deep in space but the pilot is on the space base



- Ender nodded. It was a lie, of course, that it wouldn't hurt a bit. But since adults always said it when it was going to hurt, he could count on that statement as an accurate prediction of the future. Sometimes lies were more dependable than the truth.
- The bell rang. Everyone signed off their desks or hurriedly typed in reminders to themselves. Some were dumping lessons or data into their computers at home. A few gathered at the printers while something they wanted to show was printed out. Ender spread his hands over the childsize keyboard near the edge of the desk and wondered what it would feel like to have hands as large as a grown-up's. They must feel so big and awkward, thick stubby fingers and beefy palms. Of course, they had bigger keyboardsbut how could their thick fingers draw a fine line, the way Ender could, a thin line so precise that he could make it spiral seventy-nine times from the center to the edge of the desk without the lines ever touching or overlapping. It gave him something to do while the teacher droned on about arithmetic. Arithmetic! Valentine had taught him arithmetic when he was three.
- "Then too bad. Look, Ender, I'm sorry if you're lonely and afraid. But the buggers are out there. Ten billion, a hundred billion, a million billion of them, for all we know.
  With as many ships, for all we know. With weapons we can't understand. And a willingness to use those weapons to wipe us out. It isn't the world at stake, Ender. Just us. Just humankind. As far as the rest of the biosphere is concerned, we could be wiped out and it would adjust, it would get on with the next step in evolution. But humanity doesn't want to die. As a species, we have evolved to survive. And the way we do it is by straining and straining and, at last, every few generations, giving birth to genius.
  The one who invents the wheel. And light. And flight. The one who builds a city, a nation, an empire. Do you understand any of this?"
  Ender thought he did, but wasn't sure, and so said nothing.
- "No. Of course not. So I'll put it bluntly. Human beings are free except when humanity needs them. Maybe humanity needs you. To do something. Maybe humanity needs meto find out what you're good for. We might both do despicable things, Ender, but if humankind survives, then we were good tools."
  "Is that all? Just tools?"
  "Individual human beings are all tools, that the others use to help us all survive."
  "That's a lie."
  "No. It's just a half truth. You can worry about the other half after we win this war."
- He could see Bonzo's anger growing hot. Hot anger was bad. Ender's anger was cold, and he could use it. Bonzo's was hot, and so it used him.
- "Ho Dink," said Ender. "Sit."
  "You gold-plated fart," said Dink cheerfully. "We're all trying to decide whether your scores up there are a miracle or a mistake.
  "A habit," said Ender.

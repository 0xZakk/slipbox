- Memory systems date back to antiquity. In the ancient world, a trained memory was of vital importance. There were no handy note-taking devices, and it was memory techniques and systems that enabled bards and storytellers to remember their stories, poems, and songs.
- What they did, basically, was associate each thought of a speech to a part of their own homes. These were called “loci,” or “places.”
- Simonides (circa 500 B.C.) is known as the father of the art of trained memory,
- The ancients also knew that memory training could help the thinking process itself. From a fragment dated about 400 B.C. we learn that “A great and beautiful invention is memory, always useful both for learning and for life.” And Aristotle, after praising memory systems, said that “these habits too will make a man readier in reasoning.”
- If Simonides was the inventor of the art of trained memory, and Cicero its greatest early teacher, St. Thomas Aquinas was to become its patron saint, instrumental in making the art of trained memory a devotional and ethical art.
- Eventually, they realized that any information that was already sequential could be used as loci or things to associate with other things.
- All memory, whether trained or untrained, is based on association. But that’s stating it too simply. You will be taught many systems of association in this book, but it goes much deeper than that. You see, when people say, “I forgot,” they didn’t, usually—what really happened was that they didn’t remember in the first place.
- That brings you to forcing yourself to remember originally.
- Anything of which you are Originally Aware cannot be forgotten. And, applying our systems of association will force Original Awareness. Observation is essential to Original Awareness—anything you wish to remember must first be observed.
- Original Awareness.
- It is always easier to remember things that have meaning than it is to remember things that do not.
- virtually all learning is based on memory.
- there are three basic learning skills: 1) the search for information, 2) remembering the information, and 3) applying the information.
- Here’s a basic memory rule: You Can Remember Any New Piece of Information if It Is Associated to Something You Already Know or Remember.
- you know how to consciously associate anything you want to remember to something you already know, you’ll have a trained memory. It’s as simple as that. And you can learn to
- It isn’t necessary to associate the thoughts of a speech, or anything else, to places—the thoughts may be associated to each other, so that one thought will remind you of the next thought.
- the Link system of memory.
- In Order to Remember Any New Piece of Information, It Must Be Associated to Something You Already Know or Remember in Some Ridiculous Way.
- If you take paper and pencil and try it now, on your own, you’ll see that you can list the ten items, in sequence, without missing any. Try it and see. Now, try it backward!
    - **Note:** Try writing the words down and try recifing them backwards to strengthen your memory
- motivation is an important part of memory.
- the Link system of memory.
- forming the links of a memory chain. One item must lead you to the next, if you’re associating properly.
- The one problem you may have in Linking, only at first, is in making your pictures ridiculous.
- There are four simple rules to help you do this right
- rule of Substitution
- Another rule is Out of Proportion.
- Another rule is Exaggeration.
- And, try to get Action into your pictures.
- Your imagination needs exercise, that’s all. The important point is that simply trying to apply our systems will automatically give you that exercise.
- there is not much physiological difference between the electrical signals that are activated by the mind’s eye and ones that are activated by the eye itself.
- Ad Herennium,
- If you can apply the Link and memorize ten items, then you can use it to remember twenty or thirty items. Of course, it will take more time to remember thirty items than it will to remember ten. But that would be so whether you applied the Link system or not. There is really no limit to the number of items you can memorize this way.
- once you understand how to make an intangible tangible and meaningful, it becomes easy to remember.
- you do have to use a bit of imagination, and the more often you form conscious associations, the easier it will become because you will be improving your imagination as you improve your memory.
- Imagination is the intermediary between perception and thought.
- you’re certainly better off thinking up your own Substitute Words,

- SPEECHES
    - **Note:** Apply the link system with the key thoughtf system.
      review a speech or text and describe each piece in a key thought. Then use the link system to memorizes the key thoughts
- Probably the worst mistake you can make is to try to memorize a speech word for word.
- First of all, it isn’t really necessary. The assumption is that if you’ve been asked to deliver a speech on a particular subject, you know something about that subject.
- Secondly, memorizing the speech word for word will make it sound that way when you deliver it—memorized.
- finally, when you memorize a speech word for word, you’re taking the chance of fumbling over one word you can’t remember.
- The best way to deliver a speech is to talk it in your own words, thought for thought.
- A speech is a sequence of thoughts; if the thoughts are out of sequence, the speech won’t make much sense.
- First, write out or type your speech, including all the things you want to say about all the ideas you think are important. Read it over to get the gist of it. Now for that “other idea”: Select a Key Word from each thought that will remind you of the entire thought.
- This same system—a combination of the Link and the Key Thought ideas—can be applied to reading material or lectures in almost exactly the same way. Simply Link Key Words as you read or listen. Applied to reading material, the idea forces you to read actively, with concentration; applied to lectures, it does the same thing.
- FOREIGN AND ENGLISH VOCABULARY
    - **Note:** Apply the substitute word method to foreign vocab
- This brings us to an important point. Most often, where memory is concerned, an entity consists of two things. Even the most complicated-seeming memory chores can usually be broken down into entities of two: a name to a face, an address to a person or company, a price or style number to an item, a telephone number to a person or company, a definition or meaning to a word, and so on. Even when forming a long Link, you’re
- The Substitute Word idea can be applied to any word of any language. There is no word that does not sound like, or make you think of, something in your own language.
- Misplacing something means not remembering where you placed it. When you don’t know if you locked your door, you don’t remember whether or not you locked it—absentmindedness is basically a memory problem.
- You are absentminded when your mind is absent; when you perform actions unconsciously, without thinking. We’ve discussed the difference between seeing and observing—we see with our eyes, but we observe with our minds. If your mind is “absent” when performing an action, there can be no observation; more important, there can be no Original Awareness.
- The solution to the problem of absentmindedness is both simple and obvious: All you have to do is to be sure to think of what you’re doing during the moment in which you’re doing it. That’s all, but obviously it’s easier said than done. How can you be sure to force yourself to think of a minor action at the moment you’re doing it?
- There’s only one way, and that is by using association. Since association forces Original Awareness—and since being Originally Aware is the same as having something register in your mind in the first place, at the moment it occurs—then forming an instant association must solve the problem of absentmindedness.
- Solved, that is, if you make an association each time you put down your pencil, wherever you put it. Just make it a habit. Keep the idea in mind the first few times, force yourself to form the associations, and after that it will become habitual.
- the association, no matter what it is, forces you to think of the action at that moment.
- If you’ve been applying the systems, you’ve not only improved your memory, you’ve improved your sense of imagination, concentration, and observation. By now, you must realize that in order to remember anything, you must pay attention to it—it must be observed. Applying our systems will automatically sharpen your observation.
- Those who most need to remember numbers like these have trouble for the same reason most people do—it seems impossible to picture them in the mind.
- First, to break down the idea for you, there are ten digits in our numerical system: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 0. There are also ten basic consonant phonetic sounds. (Technically, of course, there are more than ten, but the ten basic ones will serve our purpose admirably.)
- The sound that will represent number 1 will always be the sound made by the letters t or d, and vice versa.
- number 2 will always be represented by the sound made by the letter n.
- Number 3 will always be represented by the sound made by the letter m;
- Number 4 will always be represented by the sound made by the letter r.
- Number 5 will always be represented by the sound of l.
- Number 6 will always be represented by the sounds j, sh, ch, and soft g (as in gentle);
- Number 7 will always be represented by the sounds k, hard c (as in cap), hard g (as in glide).
- Number 8 will always be represented by the sound made by the letters f or v or the sound ph.
- Number 9 will always be represented by the sound made by the letters p or b.
- And, finally, the zero (0) will be represented by the hissing sound made by the letters z, s, or soft c (as in century).
- The vowels, a, e, i, o, u, have no value whatsoever in the phonetic alphabet;
- Silent letters are disregarded. The word knee would transpose to 2 in the phonetic alphabet, not 72.
- Remember, we are interested in the sound, not the letter.
- the rule for double letters. The word patter transposes to 914, not 9114. Yes, there are two t’s in the word, but they are pronounced as one
- the letter x will almost never be used, but it transposes according to the way it is pronounced in a particular word.
- The phonetic alphabet should become second nature to you.
    - **Note:** Practice
- Have we made the point? It is much, much easier to remember the tangible sentence, which makes sense, than the intangible numbers.
- There are some standards that you can start using as you keep applying the idea. For example, whenever you see a zero, simply try to pluralize what comes before it. For 975, you might use buckle; if you see 9750, simply use buckles. For 27, always try to use the -ing ending; for 97527, use buckling. When you see a 4, you can try to use the -er ending; 9754 could be buckler. And for 1, you can use the past tense; 9751 would be buckled. For 85, always try to use the -ful ending. The digits 92 might be pain, and 9285 would easily make you think of painful.
- There are two traps to avoid: transposing according to letter instead of sound, and considering a double letter as two sounds instead of one.
- Having memorized a list of items in sequence, using the Link, how would you know, say, the 8th item instantly? You wouldn’t; you’d have to go over the Link and count, either mentally or on your fingers. There’s a much easier way, using Peg Words that are based on the phonetic alphabet. This is the Peg system of memory.
- The word for 1 will always be tie. The word tie contains only one consonant sound, and that sound (t) can only represent 1.
- The word (name) that will always represent 2 is Noah. Picture whatever you like, probably a man with a long gray beard, or just the beard.
- The Peg Word for 3 will always be Ma; picture your mother, or a little old lady.
- 4: rye.
- 5: law.
- 6: shoe.
- 7: cow.
- 8: ivy.
- 9: bee.
- The number 10 contains two digits, therefore the Peg Word for 10 must have the sound t (or d, for 1) and s (for 0) in that order. The word is toes; toes can only represent 10. Picture your toes.

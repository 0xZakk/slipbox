### Highlights

- The more you try to get approval from people, the harder it will be to get it. The more that you show them that you do NOT value their opinion (thus lowering their value) and that you care more about what you think (thus raising your value), the easier it will be to get their approval.
- Value flipping is showing people they have lower value than you (or just getting them to question their own value) and having them smiling at you while you do.
- Power behaves in a strange way. If you feel as if you have it, you do. If you don't feel as if you have it, it escapes you.
- The Usual Suspects (1995).
- what prevents you from gaining power? Are you ready for this one? Nothing. There is no person, no object, and no limit of physical reality that prevents it. It's 100% in your head. To understand this is to realize that all power is a gift from the weak. ALL POWER IS A GIFT FROM THE WEAK! All power, 100% of it. Next, realize that because of this, there is no such thing as "gaining power." That's not how power works. What you hold in your head as the concept of gaining power is simply nothing more than not giving your power away. All power is a gift from the weak.
- you are the only reason that you don't have power.
- The first thing you need to understand about money is that money is only a tool. Some say that money brings happiness while others disagree. The reality of money is that it will simply bring the person who gets it more of what they already had before they had money. Give money to a person with stress in their lives, and it will buy them more stress. Give money to an unhappy person, and they will become more unhappy. Give money to someone with an already happy and fulfilling life, and you can watch the smile on their face get even bigger.
- All your fears fit into one of three categories. The first category is for things involving a statistically high physical risk. This is the category for a fear of walking into a lion cage at the zoo, pulling a gun on a police officer, and jumping out of a plane without a parachute. The second category is for things involving high financial costs. Swimming with sharks for 45 minutes off of the coast in the Bahamas is a relatively safe way to remind yourself you're alive, but it's too expensive for most people. Because the first category will get you killed and the second category may require finances that you don't have, we will focus on the third category. Coincidentally, when you fully deal with the third category, your fears in the first and second categories will vanish. OK, so what is this third category? The third category is where we file all your fears that don't directly involve lethal physical danger or spending money you don't have. These are things like participating at a fully nude beach, walking up to an attractive woman and saying hello, and singing along with your mp3 player in public as if you're the only person on the planet. It's the things that you are scared of doing simply because at some point, you decided to give your power away in these situations. There is no physical or monetary risk, yet you behave as if you are risking something tangible. You are just being a pussy.

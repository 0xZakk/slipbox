### Highlights

- The artist is the creator of beautiful things. To reveal art and conceal the artist is artâ€™s aim. The critic is he who can translate into another manner or a new material his impression of beautiful things.
- Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming. This is a fault. Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the cultivated. For these there is hope.
- We can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he does not admire it. The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one admires it intensely. All art is quite useless.

### Highlights

- What I’ve learned by teaching writing:
  1) Writers block is easy to fix. You need a note-taking system and people to talk about ideas with.
  2) Student satisfaction increases as they pay more.
  3) The most successful students write every day and publish once per week.
- 4) Online education will move towards live instruction. Self-paced courses don’t work.
  5) Writers need structure, accountability and community.
  6) Great writers have a nose for interesting ideas.
  7) Writing shouldn’t be a solo experience. It should be active and collaborative.
- 8) Education isn’t just about teaching. It’s about community. Great schools give people friends and mentors.
  9) The internet is a gift for curious people. Writing online is the single best way to attract like-minded people.
  10) The best students become community leaders.
- 11) People on Twitter under-estimate the importance of inspiration. Learning is hard. Teachers need to continuously inspire students.
  12) Niche courses are exploding. The internet is a gift for people with obscure interests. Add on community and you’ll seriously change lives.
- 13) Mass-produced courses will be extrmely popular. 
  Basic courses like “Econ 101” and “Personal Finance “will be mass-produced.
  They’ll be big budget courses with Hollywood-level production standards.
  The best teachers will teach millions of students per year.
- 14) The trade off between size and quality will disappear.
  Size will boost quality.
  A school with thousands of students can offer live instruction to anybody in the world, no matter the time zone.
  Live communities in major cities will spark friendships and accelerate learning.
- 15) Online courses aren’t about grades, motorizations, or test scores.
  Students take responsibility for their own learning.
  Real-world impact is the true measure of success.
- 16) Online courses shouldn’t be a passive experience.
  They should be active and social.
  Using platforms like Zoom, students can feel close to their teachers, chat with other students 1-on-1, and get instant feedback — all within a 60 minute session.
  Consume less. 
  Share more.
- 17) Learning is a social experience. You can’t just download information. You have to wrestle with ideas and make them your own.
  18) Student debt is a tragedy.
  19) People want high-leverage skills and high-paying jobs, but don’t want to pay a fortune for them.
- 20) Online education is for everybody now — not just tech geeks and early adopters.

  Professional tools are easy to use now.
  By publishing online, everybody can build their own credentials.
  A gift from Silicon Valley.
- 21) If you have writers block, speak into a microphone and transcribe your ideas.
  22) If you want to write well, stop trying to write like your favorite novelist. Do this instead: write short sentences, use simple words, and write like you’re talking to a friend at a bar.

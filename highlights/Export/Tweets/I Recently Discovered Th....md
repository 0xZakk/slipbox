### Highlights

- I recently discovered the key to maximizing my creativity. 
  In a regular diet, there are two main categories: 
  - Bulking (Caloric Surplus)
  - Cutting (Caloric Deficit)
  In an information diet we have:
  - Information surplus
  - Information deficit
  - A Thread -
- 1/ Why should we care about an information diet? 
  If you curate a unique information diet, you will have an information diet that no one has seen before. 
  This is the key to standing out on the internet, you will be able to provide perspectives and information no one else can
- 2/ What are surpluses and deficits? 
  At an information surplus, our creativity is slightly inhibited as we increase the number of inputs that we need to process.
  At an information deficit, we cut away all the necessary information and free up more space for creative work.
- 3/ Why is this? 
  We need to give space for our ideas to interact. @anthilemoon call this "idea sex," and notes that creativity is combinational. 
  Our best ideas occur when our brains string together connections from inputs that we would never had consciously noticed an overlap.
- 4/ Personal Info Surplus
  For the past month, I have been focused all on consumption. 
  I have been: 
  - Saving 20 articles a day
  - Making highlights to those articles 
  - Listening to podcasts whenever I go on a walk 
  I never gave time for my mind to rest and think.
- 5/ Personal Info Deficit 
  When I went to Yosemite, I left everything behind. I just focused on enjoying myself in nature. 
  This allowed for my ideas to resurface and connect in my head. I never had such a full creative well of ideas. (similar to @daretorant right now)
- 6/ Takeaways
  Give time where you are not always busy consuming or creating. 
  There needs to be space for your brain to operate itself to truly connect all the ideas you had previously interacted with.

  Past doesn't exist in reality; it exists inside your head.
- There's no Karma.
  The concept of good and bad is a human construct; the Universe doesn't know it.
- There's only one thing in the Universe that's truly in your hand: your attention.
  Your life is a collection of thoughts you pay attention to.
- Everyone is living in a different world. 
  If you put two people in the same situation, they will experience it differently.
- The only person who will stay with you till your last breath is *you*.
- Pain becomes suffering when you keep thinking about it all day long.
- Your desires aren't truly yours.
  Most of your desires are programmed inside your head by society.
- All of humanity's knowledge is made-up stuff; some of it is useful.
- True understanding > forced discipline.
- You experience the reality through your body, but live it inside your head.

### Highlights

- Before you start thinking about building an audience, you need to build some credibility. People will only listen if you've demonstrated some credibility on the topic.
  A few examples that worked for me: ðŸ‘‡
- When I had 0 followers, I wrote about why I abandoned a cushy career in big tech. I had automatic authority on this story, since I was the subject.
  Documenting why I left all that behind earned me some credibility on how to reason about lifestyle design. https://t.co/jAyRdBSJtI
- A few days later, I described how I organized my finances as I was preparing to transition to self-employment. I received 200 questions over email/DMs from people thinking about doing the same thing, and that earned me some credibility in personal finance. https://t.co/hG1d2pVSEC
- 2 wks after I self-published my AWS book, I shared everything I did to make it happen, including financial details. This earned me credibility in various things, such as making money from digital products, social media marketing, building an audience, etc. https://t.co/OrQlrmC1WK
- There were many others, but the above were probably the most impactful. The interesting thing is that it took me almost no effort to earn these bits of credibility. A blog post, a screenshot, a tweet, answering a few questions, etc.
  I was just sharing what had already happened.
- If you did something interesting, but you're keeping it all to yourself, you're losing a big opportunity.
  Chances are, you're credible on a lot of things. If you want to emerge from the unknown, this is how you do it: Share what you know, what you did, what you experienced! ðŸ’ª

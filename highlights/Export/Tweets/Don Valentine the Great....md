### Highlights

- Don Valentine, the greatest of all time. I spent the morning watching his GSB talk. Rest in peace:
  1. If you don't attack a big market, it's highly unlikely you're ever going to build a big company.

- 2. We don't spend a lot of time wondering where people went to school. 
  We are interested in their idea about the market they are after. 
  The magnitude of the problem they are solving. 
  And what can happen if the combination of Sequoia and the individuals are correct.
- 3. We don't choose people. We choose markets. 
  And once we choose a market, there is a primary product. 
  We rarely invest in an area where there is only one product.
  If you think of the Apple computer as a system - we knew we'd need to finance one or more memory companies.
- 4. Without the memory system, the PC is nothing. 
  So if you keep digging away at the system, what else do you invest in?
  We financed the system: the mouse, the best GUI, etc.
  We invested on a system/application level & made over 15 investments in that category including EA.
- 5. We have gone into business with some people who had no business credentials.
  We organized the companies in ways so people who ran them could do so based on the limited experience they had.
  We taught them outsourcing. We taught them that you only had to do a few things well.
- 6. First, you had to be very good at technology and engineering. 
  And that normally took us about 6 people to start the company.
  The 2nd skill we were interested in establishing was marketing so that we could tell what the dynamics of the market were.
- 7. With our checkbook at Sequoia, we were not interested in creating markets. 
  It's too expensive.
  We were interested in exploiting markets early.
- 8. The right people to invest in are technologists. People who have a dream to solve a problem. 
  Most were not interested in becoming wealthy. That was an accident. 
  They were interested in solving technology problems and creating new products.
- 9. We have always had a search function looking for the people we want to populate our companies with.
  Unlike other people in the venture business, we don't wait for you to knock on our door. 
  At Sequoia, we knock on your door.
- 10. The art of storytelling is critically important. 
  And most of the entrepreneurs who come talk to us can't tell a story.
  Learning to tell a story is incredibly important because that's how the money works. 
  The money flows as a function of the stories.
- 11. One of the critical things that I would encourage you to learn that is way more important in my world than anything else is 'how to ask a question'.
  For a long time, we don't understand the product or market while listening. 
  We constantly work on developing the questions.
- 12. There is only one metric that matters in finance in our world. It's cashflow.
  We hire people that are wizards at cashflow. We don't have balance sheets.
  We love recessions. Best time to invest in our experience. Recessions don't hurt us. 
  We look forward to recessions.

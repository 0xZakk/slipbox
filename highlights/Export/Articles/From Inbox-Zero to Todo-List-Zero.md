### Highlights

- “as a manager, every item on your to-do list is an exception.” She meant it as an extreme lesson in delegation, in other words:try to delegate everythingbut keep the things on your own to-do list that you can’t delegateand see those as an opportunity to get better at delegation. (i.e. an opportunity to uplevel your people at new tasks, in the future)
- Items on your to-do list are unfunded mandates unless they’re also on your calendar.You can prioritize, bucket, and color-code your to-do list at nauseum but unless you make the time to actually DO them, the list is worthless as a productivity tool.
- As a manager, your time is your most precious resource
- You’re constantly getting pulled into meetings, and unless you take control over your calendar, you’ll find it completely full of low-leverage activities.
- Your time belongs to you and nobody else. This applies equally to the CEO and the entry-level employee.
- Summary/PhilosophyTo sum this up:Your time belongs to you and nobody else. Even if you work for a salary.Inbox Zero: Stuff in your inbox that needs your attention should go immediately onto your to-do list.Todo List Zero: Stuff on your to-do list that needs more than a moment to resolve should get onto your calendar.Block out time in advance for #3, at the time of day where you get your best work done (figure this out if you don’t already know). Also block out time for self-initiated tasks: time to do nothing but think, time to learn and read, etc.

## Highlights

### Highlights

- Athletes train. Musicians train. Performers train. But knowledge workers don’t.
- Knowledge workers should train like LeBron, and implement strict “learning plans.” To be sure, intellectual life is different from basketball. Success is harder to measure and the metrics for improvement aren’t quite as clear. Even then, there’s a lot to learn from the way top athletes train. They are clear in their objectives and deliberate in their pursuit of improvement.
- knowledge workers should train to build skills, complete projects, and increase their productive power. Armed with an effective system, we’ll learn faster and have more fun doing it.
- Learn in three-month sprints and commit to a new learning project every quarter.
- you should break down the project into daily increments, and create a series of daily and weekly goals to learn the skills required to complete the project on time.
- Start by writing down a positive vision for your future
- The learning project needs to be challenging enough to demand focus, but easy enough to make consistent progress. That way, you can enter the optimal state of learning.
- Even if your learning plan is bounded by a strict goal, the details should be flexible.
- I encourage you to share your learnings. Publish an essay, a book review, an art project, or open source your code. Sharing your ideas will help you digest them

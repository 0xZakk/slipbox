### Highlights

- We live in a society of adult-like children and childish adults.
- Kids have never had more information at their fingertips, so they’re growing up faster than ever. From a young age, they can watch violent war clips on YouTube, Dan Bilzerian videos on Instagram, and Shakira getting low at the Super Bowl halftime show.
  Yet, even though they grow up fast at first, they mature into adulthood slowly. Young people today are often unable to become financially independent or walk the path of a meaningful life. As a result, we’re left with a culture of childish adults who are allergic to commitment and unable to see the light in adulthood.
- Adult-Like Children
- Video destroyed the innocence of childhood.
- Kids were shielded from money, death, violence, and especially, sex
- Kids couldn’t read until their teenage years, so adults concealed taboo topics in writing.
- In our video-first age, children and adults watch the same things on television, which was never true for books.
- Childish Adults
- While children act like adults, adults also act like children
- That changed with the invention of television,
- With the rise of video, the social—and moral—transition from childhood into adulthood disappeared
- As Neil Postman wrote: “Everywhere one looks, the behavior, language, attitudes, and desires—even the physical appearance—of adults and children are becoming increasingly indistinguishable.”
- Gone are the coming-of-age rituals which once carried the maturing mind forward
- The aversion to adulthood is most evident in cities, where people lack family, religion, and community.
- Since the Enlightenment, people in The West have chosen the path of more freedom at every turn. But we made a Faustian bargain. In search of individuality, we freed ourselves from family, church, and community.
- The Hopelessness of Adulthood and the “Adulting” Meme
- On the surface, the meme is a response to the overwhelming number of things you need to do as an adult: go to the gym, get your work done, answer emails, make the bed, clean the kitchen, sweep the floors, file taxes, buy groceries, put the kids to bed.
  On a deeper level, though, I think this meme stems from a perception of adulthood as a hopeless enterprise. It represents a mentality that encourages people to retreat into a nihilistic, bubble-wrapped cocoon of deferred responsibility.
- That passivity is the mark of a generation overwhelmed by contemporary life. They lack clear role models for how to behave. Our anything-goes world suffers from a tempest of uncertainty about how to “adult.” Noble virtues—honor, courage, loyalty—are dismissed. Without these beacons of direction, young adults retreat to a nook of passivity where they defer the responsibilities of adulthood.
- In a very real way, those college years were sold as the peak. We never thought life could improve after graduation, and we dreaded the monotonous, desk-chained rituals of adulthood. All that rebellious energy was set to fire by movies like Animal House and Project X, which celebrated the freedom of life without adults. College was the only time we’d have autonomy, so instead of discovering our telos, we flew the flag of anarchy.
- I’m learning. I first confronted my aversion to responsibility in 2018, when I had just been laid off from a job and was struggling to build my first business. Desperate for clients, I called my mentor Brent. When he asked why I wanted to work for myself, I said, “I want the freedom to do what I want.”
  With grace and generosity, Brent encouraged me to reconsider my lust for freedom and embrace virtues like duty, thrift, and commitment. He explained to me that responsibility can be more rewarding and meaningful than freedom alone.
- Trying to Adul
- We Need to Replace “Freedom From” with “Freedom To”
- Sasse writes:
  “Adolescents put off adult responsibilities for as long as they can, sometimes by choice but more often as a result of circumstances and trends beyond their comprehension. In the face of unprecedented prosperity and freedom from convention, the generation coming of age is stuck in a hazy, extended adolescence, never allowed simply to be children, and yet also rarely nudged to be fully adult.”
- Ben Sasse, the aforementioned Senator of Nebraska and the former President of Midland College distinguishes between “freedom to” virtues and “freedom from” ones.
- Outwardly, we said “college was the best four years of our lives.” But inwardly, we had no hope for the future.
- I hope that in the future, we’ll see meaning and responsibility as two sides of the same coin
- A life well-lived demands a forward-leaning embrace of responsibility. We should drop the freedom from mindset and welcome the freedom to learn, the freedom to work, and the freedom to tackle meaningful challenges.
- In the end, until we can restore the innocence of childhood, appreciate the wisdom only literacy can provide, and find beauty in the wrinkles of old age, we will feed a culture of adultish children and childish adults.

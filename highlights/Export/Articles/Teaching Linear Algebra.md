### Highlights

- In preparation for the class I set myself goals around how well the students would learn the material taught. After some thought I settled on four ideas that I would use:
  Homework not present at the start of class would not be accepted. However students were only graded on the best 20 out of 27 possible homework sets.
  All homework sets were cumulative. Generally 1/3 was the current day's material, 1/3 from the last week, and 1/3 from anywhere in the course. Those thirds were in increasing order of difficulty.
  Every class would start with a question and answer session to last no less than 10 minutes.
  Every student could expect to be asked at least one question every other class.
- Homework not present at the start of class would not be accepted. However students were only graded on the best 20 out of 27 possible homework sets.
- The point was to make sure that class started on time, with everyone ready to pay attention for question and answer time. I also didn't want to deal with people doing homework during lecture, evaluating sick excuses, etc. The leniency of not having to turn in 7 homework sets compensated for the rigidness of the policy. And cumulative homework sets meant that I didn't have to worry about students not practicing any given day's material.
- All homework sets were cumulative. Generally 1/3 was the current day's material, 1/3 from the last week, and 1/3 from anywhere in the course. Those thirds were in increasing order of difficulty.
- This was the most important idea I wanted to try. I had long been aware that research on memory had demonstrated that when you're reminded of something as you're forgetting it, it goes into much longer term memory. As a result periodic review at lengthening intervals is very effective in increasing long term recall. A typical effective study schedule being to review after half an hour, the next day, the next week, then the next month.
- Now of course you can tell students this until you're blue in the face - but they won't do it. However when the study schedule is disguised as homework, they don't have a choice.
- Every class would start with a question and answer session to last no less than 10 minutes.
- For me this was the most important part of the class. The questions that came up in this session were my opportunity to refresh people on what they were forgetting, and were how I kept track of what topics should come in for more review on future homework sessions. Given my knowledge of how critical review is to learning, I honestly felt that time spent answering questions was more valuable than lecture. As long as there were questions, there was no maximum on how much time I was willing to spend on this.
- Of course the challenge is getting students to ask questions. My strategy was simple: I told them that someone will ask questions and someone will answer them, but they don't want me to be the one asking questions.
- Every student could expect to be asked at least one question every other class.
- Every few minutes I'd stop, say, "Let's make that a question," ask the question, pause so everyone could think through the answer, then ask a random person the question. I made sure to rotate people around so that everyone got their turn fairly.
- I treated failure to get the answer as my failures, not theirs. If they couldn't get the answers then they weren't following the lecture, and I needed to slow it down, figure out the rough spots, etc.
- As a bonus I managed to convince the entire class that taking notes was not worthwhile.
- So were there any downsides? Unfortunately there were some big ones.
- I had set goals around learning. I failed to set any around happiness.
- Having to pay attention during class was hard on the class.

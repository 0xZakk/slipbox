## Highlights

- ==**The school I want to build helps people start writing, build an online audience, and start a company in their niche. They’ll graduate once they have a profitable business.**==
- **Writing online is the fastest way to accelerate your career.** In Write of Passage, we already help students start writing online. Next, we will help them maintain a weekly publishing cadence and attract a niche audience of trusted readers. **Once a student builds their audience to a critical mass, we will help them launch an online business.**
- Write of Passage will follow the CrossFit model.
- The existing course resembles the first five weeks of CrossFit training, but students are desperate for more.
- Next, we want to open a subscription “writing gym.”
- **The third and final step is building a collection of Audience-First Products.** Each student will be encouraged to attract readers in an obscure niche. **Writing online teaches you entrepreneurship because the skills you need to build an audience overlap the skills you need to build a business.** It’s a process of discovery because you can only write well about ideas you’re interested in. **Furthermore, writing about an industry is one of the fastest ways to learn about it.** As a student’s audience grows, their readers will tell them about their problems and industry trends, both of which will inform their future business.
- **Once students have an email list of 5,000 people who trust them and share their interest in a valuable niche, they can build a software business.** Not a Facebook size one, but **a capital-light, software-driven product like EndCrawl**, which builds, edits, and renders end credits for feature films or Jetboost, which provides no-code add-ons for Webflow websites. You probably haven’t heard about these businesses, and that’s the point. **The total addressable market for profitable niches on the Internet numbers in the millions.**
- **Using an audience, we will help people build a business that makes $200,000+ per year in profit for the founder.** Once they reach that threshold, they’ll be able to support their families and control their destinies, no matter where they live. We’ll take a 10% ownership in each business, similar to Y-Combinator. All our companies will be built upon existing social media platforms like Twitter, scalable server infrastructure like Amazon Web Services, and No-Code platforms like Shopify and Zapier.
- **Ultimately, we will use the Internet to build thousands of profitable and sustainable software businesses that people can run from anywhere in the world.** Inspired by CrossFit and made possible by the Internet, Write of Passage will become the business school of the future.

## Highlights

### Highlights

- For Anki beginners, habit & friction is your enemy. Maintaining a daily routine is critical.
- Use a computer to add cards to Anki. It is hard to add cards on mobile.
- Add simple cards.
- Keep a daily habit to review all your cards. In the beginning, reviewing take two to four minutes. It's easy to skip and then catch up, but having a routine will be critical later.
- I prefer creating cloze cards. Proper cloze cards add meaningful context and improve fundamental understanding. Takes slightly more time to add.
- Add images. Our brains are wired visually, so this helps retention.
- BACKUP YOUR ANKI DECK BEFORE INSTALLING ADD-ONS.
- Turn on Autosyncing. The app will now sync when you open or when you've finished a deck (per 30 minutes).
- If you have more than fifteen minutes of Anki, turn on airplane mode first. Your phone/tablet's notifications were made to distract you. Turn back on after reviewing.
- What I cannot create, I do not understand. â€” Richard Feynman
- Most people use Anki as a way to amplify memory. I use Anki for memory AND to fundamentally learn.
- Use multimodal study strategies. Using different modes of learning can enforce an idea.
- Use mnemonics phrases like PEMDAS for lists and other hard-to-remember topics.

- On books
- The single most common question: how do you read so much?
- I’ve really read all the time since I was a little kid, it's been a lifelong thing. It's basically trying to try to fill in all the puzzle pieces for the big discrepancies.A great term is “sense-making”. Essentially, what the hell is happening and why? The world's an incredibly complex and erratic place and trying to figure that out ...is kind of a lifetime occupation.
- The thing I've tried to do the last few years is really ‘barbell’ the inputs. I basically read things that are either up to this minute or things that are timeless...
  They are Lindy safe.
- So how do you go from zero to one in a new space? Where do you start? Do you go breadth first or depth first?
- Part of being a firm is - we get to know and talk to a lot of people. So a lot of it, honestly, is face to face conversations. Often the way you learn about something is because somebody tells you about it.
- I’ll often ask those people who else I can talk to or what I can read.
- The problem of having to finish every book is you’re not only spending time on books you shouldn’t be but it also causes you to stall out on reading in general.
- The other technique is to read a dozen books at a time.

### Highlights

- Your first draft is for generating ideas:
  
- This works best when you’re exploring ideas that most interest you. The more self-indulgent you are, the better your article.
- An objective reveals what your article must accomplish to be successful. You can work backwards from it to identify your talking points.
  
- Every argument has two types of talking points:
  Supporting points: Which points are needed to make my argument?
  Resulting points: What are the implications of my argument being true?
- Before writing, choose an objective to focus your thinking.
- Every argument has two types of talking points:
  Supporting points: Which points are needed to make my argument?
  Resulting points: What are the implications of my argument being true?
- It’s normal if not many ideas come to mind immediately. You’ll often discover your best ideas while writing — not before. You write in order to think.
- You'll discover even more ideas by resting and reflecting on what you’ve written. The act of writing compels your brain to draw connections between ideas. It can’t help itself.
- While brainstorming, focus on ideas that are interesting or surprising.
- When ideas stop flowing, ask yourself:
  How can I make my point more convincing?
  What are the interesting implications of what I just said?
  Repeatedly ask these two questions and keep moving in whichever direction interests you most.
- Graham’s Method: First, learn all the basics on a topic. Then, if you can find new information that surprises even your knowledgeable self, it’ll surprise laypeople too.

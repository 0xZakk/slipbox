## Highlights

### Highlights

- If we want to be all-knowing, like these people, we have to read a lot of books.
  
- Who says every word of the book is worth reading—especially in sequential order?
- “layered reading.
- By reading a book in layers, you can easily digest the parts of the book that are interesting to you, and quickly get an idea of the whole book.
- about. Most non-fiction books have one central premise.
- The point of Layer 1 is to get a birds-eye view of the “argument” of the book. What is the author saying and how is the argument structured?
- The purpose of this layer is to gain a slightly deeper understanding of what each chapter is about.
- The point of Layer 2 is to find the central premise of each chapter
- Then go and scan those chapters. Don’t read each and every line. Focus on the subheads and the first sentence of each paragraph.
- Go back to the TOC and re-read it with your now deeper knowledge of the book and its argument. It’s likely some of the chapter titles that were not-so-interesting at first glance are now more appealing. If you find yourself asking new questions, go investigate those chapters with the same approach as Layer 2.
- I then lay a bunch of books out in front of me and read the first layer of each one. One or two will pop out at me, so I’ll investigate the next layer. Then, I’ll pick one to dive into deeper.

## Highlights

### Highlights

- You don’t start companies to get rich. You start them for reasons you don’t fully understand, and like a runner at the 18th mile, often question why you subjected yourself to such euphoric misery that is a startup.
- We’ll discuss two types of optimizations. One in terms of how to think about optimizing wealth, and another more tactical section.
- Dilution Matters.
- Cognitive Optimizations
- Founders treat equity as binary. Worthless until the video game ends. Suddenly you ring in the IPO and you’re a billionaire. For the most part this is the right way to think about it.
- However, you’re very likely to have an outcome in the middle. One where 1% of your company isn’t worth a billion dollars, but it’s worth a million. So when that VC offers you more money for more dilution, think twice! Don’t make this classic error.
- Penny Pinching.
- Overbearing frugality prevented me from spending any money, which creates inefficiencies. Spend like a king on speed, like a pauper on everything else.
- If you can, use your capital to move faster.
- Stop hacking airline miles and credit cards.
- Take all that energy and focus it on your startup. The ultimate ticket to First Class will come through making money, not flyertalk.com.
- Taxes Are Real
- Tactical Optimizations
- QSBS. If you have gross assets of $50 million or less, you can avoid federal (and occasionally state) tax
- Secondary
- Simplicity
- Here is the most important tip that nobody told me about: keep your finances simple. Assuming you have assets, confusion might be the largest cause of financial stress for you.
- Illiquidity
- Invest in things that quietly compound over the long term.
- I find it much easier to live my life with illiquid assets that aren’t valued every day.
- Portfolio Allocation.
- Do whatever will enable you to sleep best
- Get An Accountant.

### Highlights

- Each Year Passes Differently
- I’ve come to appreciate that each year passes in a unique way.
- The Lessons Behind the Goals
- Here are my top 5 lessons from 2019:
- 1. The power of writing
- Almost exactly one year ago, I decided to launch my blog. The impetus at the time was simply to distill my thoughts and have a medium to share them. More tangibly, I really just wanted to write this article about remote work. However, something unexpected happened almost immediately: people cared.
- Perhaps most rewarding were the connections and opportunities (including my current job), that were due to my decision to launch this thing. This is something I’m proud of.
- But the lesson here isn’t about me. It’s simply that this wouldn’t have been possible 30 years ago. In an age of infinite leverage, the ability to share your ideas through mediums like the Internet, is unprecedented. And the best way to do so? Through writing.
- Prior to 2019, I was under the impression that there was just too much content out there. I’ve now come to realize that the truth is, there is too much low-quality content out there. When used with care, I see more opportunity than ever in the written word.
- 3. Career enmeshment
- oogle defines enmeshment as “a relationship between two or more people in which personal boundaries are permeable and unclear”.
- The term career enmeshment was recently coined by Janna Koretz, but is something that I and many others have long experienced.
- My career had become my identity. It took me a while to process this and gain the confidence to step away from leadership and explore a new role that would let me refocus on my skills.
- 4. The delicate balance of monetizing
- I had a goal in 2019 to reach $1k MRR. I did not hit this goal and quite frankly, found this the hardest goal to make substantial progress on.
- 5. Three core priorities
- Perhaps the most important lesson of 2019 was one that I wrote about in February, but quickly forgot in the context of my own life.
- The idea is simple: approaching your life in epochs or seasons, so that you can not only focus more effectively on one particular area of your life, but also have peace of mind when you put some things on the backburner. With this concept in mind, I’ll have overarching goals, but will focus on one, maybe two key projects outside of my core work. The rest? It’ll have to wait until the next season.
- Looking forward: A New Decade

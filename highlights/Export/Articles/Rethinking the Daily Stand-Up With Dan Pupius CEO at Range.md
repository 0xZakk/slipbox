### Highlights

- But with Range, Dan is not trying to replace the stand-up. He’s seen first hand how powerful stand-ups can be for a team’s sense of alignment and their ability to execute. Rather, he’s trying to make them even more valuable for each team member, whether they’re onsite or remote, individual contributors or managers. He sees an opportunity to replace that transactional communication with inclusive, impactful collaborative time
- At their core, Dan says, stand-ups are intended to allow teammates to develop a shared understanding, coordinate efforts, and collaborate on problems. However, many teams are made up of individuals operating on their own: their work streams are linear and don’t overlap with other team members’ work, and there are few opportunities to really collaborate on solutions together. On these teams, stand-ups become mechanisms for sharing status updates. 
  “Status updates are a very transactional form of communication and don’t need to happen synchronously in person,” he acknowledges.
- Dan acknowledges building a team of the right people who work well together, and are also making significant progress relative to expectations, is hard work. And it gets even more challenging to maintain as the environments in our organizations become increasingly complex.
  “My job as a manager is to create an environment for success by building culture and setting up processes that make the team’s work easier. My job often isn’t to participate in the work itself,” he says. “To help teams be successful I need to pay attention to their needs: work needs, safety needs, emotional and flexibility needs.”
- Instead, he orients stand-ups to become a facilitated conversation where developers can have deeper discussions around specific problems, experiences, or decisions.
- When team members can unblock problems, learn from peers, or get social recognition from the team, they walk away with a better experience — a deeper sense of trust and connection with their teammates.
- Stand-ups are productive team-building events
- In practice, yes, managers need frequent check-ins from their team members. They need to know what’s happening and how things are going on a daily basis. Dan recommends facilitating these check-ins outside of the valuable in-person time. Then he suggests integrating important topics brought up in these check-ins into the team-wide stand-up, to facilitate knowledge sharing and build camaraderie.
  “I’m not just sharing with my manager that way; I’m sharing with my team,” he says. “It doesn’t feel like I’m just reporting up. It feels like I’m contributing to a group effort.”
- Using “flags” to be more efficient
- During stand-ups, Dan pulls out what he calls “flags” from the check-ins. These are anything stemming from a check-in that asks for action, whether that be a thank you, a celebration, an FYI, or a notice that someone is blocked. Those, then, become the discussion points for the team.
- Stand-ups allow team members—and managers—to push the information to the people who need it. The team stays close-knit by meeting regularly. And the developers who are collaborating closely can always get more value by reading more of each other’s check-ins than they cover in the stand-up.
- Building discussion in rounds creates space for everyone to participate
- While Dan is in favor of skipping status updates when possible, he emphasizes that meetings are important. He recommends that regular team meetings use recurring agendas, one that includes looking at flagged items, while retaining a section that is built dynamically in each stand-up.
- The second tactic is a round (or multiple rounds) of building an agenda. Again, every person must speak each time around—and if they don’t want to add anything, they still have to vocalize their “pass.”
- Build a round-robin agenda
- The check-in round
  The first tactic is what Range calls the check-in round. It can be an ice-breaker question (such as one of these 200 used at Range), or simply people sharing what’s on their mind. Whatever the topic of discussion, the act of going around the team levels the playing field—everyone has already spoken up once, and research shows that underrepresented groups are more likely to speak up if they speak up earlier in the meeting.
- Keep discussion relevant — to everyone
- One of the keys to keeping everyone engaged and included in a stand-up is to keep the stand-up relevant to them. Range’s stand-ups, in this sense, are ideal for small teams, because these meetings are only useful if they’re actively collaborating together (at least for the duration of the meeting, if not beyond).
- Figuring out the right duration and frequency for the work and personalities of a given team is also critical. Some teams meet daily for fifteen minutes; Range developers meet twice a week for an hour. Whatever the schedule is, it should permit an intentional time for collaboration.
- Constantly evolve to suit the team
- As mentioned above, Dan meets with his teams for an hour twice a week. He didn’t land on that schedule randomly. In part, it suited his availability as both CEO and a member of the product team. But more than that, his team found that that cadence suited their workflow.
  “We’d work for a couple of days, and then we’d have stuff we wanted to bring to the group,”
- In other words, the way teams do stand-ups isn’t prescribed, and it certainly isn’t set in stone. It evolves. Constantly.
- “There's this cycle I see at many companies. It starts out with someone believing there are too many meetings. So they stop the meetings, but then no one knows what's happening,” Dan says. “So, they bring meetings back. They end off fluctuating between too few meetings and too many meetings, without actually solving the root problem of how to hold meetings.”
- That’s why Range decided to rethink the way they hold stand-ups:
  Stand-ups should have value for everyone attending. The manager’s role is to create an environment for success, rather than directing the work. That means stand-ups can be events that bolster and connect the team socially. At the same time, they also focus on “flags,” or important items for celebration or collaboration, in lieu of comprehensive (and largely irrelevant) status updates.
  Building stand-up discussions as round-robins encourages everyone to participate. Range starts each stand-up with a check-in round where everyone speaks. The team then builds the agenda in multiple rounds, wherein again, everyone speaks each time—even if that is just to say “I pass.” And if discussions become irrelevant to some team members, then the discussion is moved outside the stand-up.
  The stand-up format is never set in stone. It continuously evolves based on team feedback and the needs of all engineers on the team, so that it (and the team) can continue to improve.

### Highlights

- These distractions aren’t just unproductive, they’re anti-productive. They create more work than they replace.
- The same way removing stress and strain from our physical bodies causes them to become fragile and weak, removing mental stress and strain from our minds makes them fragile and weak.
- The same way the consumer economy of the 20th century called upon us to invent the nutritional diet, I believe that the attention economy of the 21st century calls upon us to invent an attention diet
- Basically, the name of the game is quality over quantity
-  Because in a world with infinite information and opportunity, you don’t grow by knowing or doing more, you grow by the ability to correctly focus on less.
- There are three steps to the Attention Diet:
  Correctly identify nutritious information and relationships.
  Cut out the junk information and relationships.
  Cultivate habits of deeper focus and a longer attention span.
- end up using it to numb a lot of our day-to-day stresses and insecurities
- The goal here is to push yourself to stay more focused on what adds value to your life

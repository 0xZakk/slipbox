- **Summary:** 
- **Highlights:**
    - Spends a really long time thinking about and developing the first minute
    - He keeps a list of topics that viewers have suggested in the comments of his videos. Goes through this list and picks the one he is in the mood to make.
        - Only makes videos he's in the mood to make. Doesn't try to force himself to make a video that he isn't in the mood to make.
    - Typically changes to match his outfit with the video he's making. If it's a video about not working a 9 to 5, then he doesn't wear a suit and tie. Dresses more formally for real estate, business, and money videos
    - Then he figures out what to say and in what order. He doesn't write a script or use a teleprompter
        - Just creates an outline of bullet points and talks through those as he records
        - He doesn't want to sound like he's reading from a script, so he sticks with just an outline and then just talks to the camera
    - Making a polished video takes a lot of work and takes time.
    - Tries slightly different camera angles, backgrounds, and locations and tries to mix them up with each video.
        - Once the camera is set up, he uses a Comica lapel mic that connects to the camera. The mic works really well.
        - Always tests out the audio before getting into recording! Recorded a whole video only to discover that the audio wasn't working.
    - He spends a really long time on the first minute.
        - If you don't have a good first minute, then you'll lose 90% of the viewers and never get them back to watch that video
        - The first minute is the most important part of the video
        - Make the first minute epic!
    - He always thinks the video he makes is terrible once he finishes recording
    - Make sure everything is charged and have backup batteries
        - The mic battery can die, the camera battery can die
    - Records a lot of footage and edits it down. Will record 30 to 60 minutes and record that down to 10 to 20 minutes.
    - Then uploads the video, makes a thumbnail, and schedules it to be published

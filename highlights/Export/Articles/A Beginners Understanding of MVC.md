### Highlights

- The Controller is often referred to as the “glue” between the Model and View component.
- View is used for the interface of our application
- The Model component is where all the data that a user works with is defined. This is data that’s transferred between the View and Controller components.
- MVC stands for Model View Controller and is one of the most popular patterns for structuring web applications. MVC is a configured method that arranges our application into three components. Essentially, this gives us separation of function and structure by storing specific coded function in named files in similarly named folders.

### Highlights

- Ghost is an alternative to Substack that allows you to start hosted and then migrate to your own server when desired. It's open source, so it's fully customizable. And it has membership and monetization features included.
- Why not Substack? It's wonderful, but as a centralized service it doesn't offer the same degree of customizability and flexibility.
- Before we begin: a note on pseudonymity and opsec
- One of the awesome things about Ghost is that it allows you to build an audience and monetize pseudonymously to protect your privacy.

- The Brain That Changes Itself,
- **Tags:** #read
- **Note:** .read
- This new research includes some 37 neurological studies on porn users, as well as 12 new reviews of the literature, all by some of the world’s top neuroscientists.
- There are also some 15 studies revealing escalation of porn use or habituation to porn (a sign of tolerance, and of addiction). Among them can be found evidence of both tolerance and withdrawal symptoms.
- With respect to porn-induced sexual problems there are now 23 studies linking porn use and porn addiction to sexual problems and lower arousal to sexual stimuli. In four of these papers, there is also evidence of causation because the men healed problems by eliminating porn use.
- In addition, more than 50 studies now link porn use to less sexual and relationship satisfaction.
- Similarly, some 40 studies link porn use to poorer cognitive function and mental health problems.
- Urologists are seeing an ominous drop in the average age of their patients and are exploring all plausible causes.
- ## INTRODUCTION
- I count him braver who overcomes his desires than him who conquers his enemies; for the hardest victory is over self. Aristotle
- If you’re anything like the thousands of other people who have realised that they have a problem, it has probably taken you a while to connect your troubles with your porn use. You might have thought you were struggling with some other disorder. Perhaps you thought you had developed unaccustomed depression or social anxiety or, as one man feared, premature dementia. Or maybe you believed that you had low testosterone or were simply getting older. You might even have been prescribed drugs from a well-meaning doctor.
- At the moment, mainstream culture tends to assume that pornography use cannot cause severe symptoms. And, as high-profile criticisms of pornography often come from religious and socially conservative organizations, it’s easy for liberally minded people to dismiss them without examination.
- This is about the nature of our brains and how they respond to cues from a radically changed environment. This is about the effects of chronic overconsumption of sexual novelty, delivered on demand in endless supply. This is about youthful access to limitless hardcore streaming videos – a phenomenon which is moving so quickly that researchers have not been able to stay current.
- The symptoms these men (and later women) described strongly suggested that their use of pornography had re-trained, and made significant material changes to, their brains.
- The men on the forum found such material and the research underlying it both comforting and helpful. At last they understood how porn had hijacked the primitive appetite mechanisms of their brains. These ancient brain structures urge us toward evolutionarily beneficial behaviours including an appreciation of novel mates, helping to discourage inbreeding.
- However, our behavioural choices in turn affect our neurochemical balance in these same brain structures. This is how chronic overconsumption can have unexpected effects. It can make us hyper-aroused by our favourite enticements, such that immediate wants weigh heavier than they should relative to longer term desires. It can also sour our enjoyment of – and responsiveness to – everyday pleasures. It can drive us to seek more extreme stimulation. Or cause withdrawal symptoms so severe that they send even the most strong-minded of us bolting for relief. It can also alter our mood, perception and priorities – all without our conscious awareness.
- In May, 2014, the prestigious medical journal JAMA Psychiatry published research showing that, even in moderate porn users, use (number of years and current hours per week) correlates with reduced grey matter and decreased sexual responsiveness. The study was subtitled “The Brain on Porn”.[12] The researchers cautioned that the heavy porn users’ brains might have been pre-shrunken rather than shrunken by porn usage, but favoured degree-of-porn-use as the most plausible explanation. Said lead author Simon Kühn: That could mean that regular consumption of pornography more or less wears out your reward system.
- ## 1 WHAT ARE WE DEALING WITH?
- It is not the answer that enlightens, but the question. Eugene Ionesco
- Most users regard internet porn as a solution – to boredom, sexual frustration, loneliness or stress. However, about ten years ago, some porn users started to connect various problems with their porn use.
- In 2012, a guy on an online forum known as Reddit/NoFap recounted the history of how men first figured out what they were dealing with (the onomatopoeic term ‘fap’ is slang for ‘masturbation to porn’): Around 2008/2009, people started surfacing on the internet who were freaked out that they had erectile dysfunction, but at the same time they could get a solid erection to varying degrees of extreme porn with the help of some good old deathgrip [masturbation]. The weird thing was, that in some cases, thousands of people responded to these forum posts, saying they had the same exact symptoms. Now, taking those symptoms into account, people figured they’d desensitised themselves to real women by escalating to evermore extreme genres of porn and masturbating [such] that no woman’s vagina could match the stimulation. They hoped/guessed that if they’d stop watching porn and masturbating for a significant amount of time this desentisation might be reversed.
- [Quitting porn] helped reverse the porn-induced ED of these guys, and besides normal libido they started reporting other positive changes too: depression and social anxiety going away, increased confidence, the feeling of fulfilment and being on top of the world...
- The earliest people to report porn-related problems in online forums were typically computer programmers and information-technology specialists. They had acquired high-speed internet porn ahead of the pack – and then developed uncharacteristic sexual tastes, delayed ejaculation or erectile dysfunction (ED) during sex.
- In 2006, high-speed internet gave rise to a whole new creature: galleries of short porn clips of the hottest few minutes of an unending supply of streaming hardcore videos. They are called ‘tube sites’ because they stream like YouTube videos. The world of porn has never been the same.
- Deep in a primitive part of the brain, surfing tube sites registers as really valuable because of all the sexual novelty. The extra excitement strengthens brain circuits that urge you to seek porn again and again. Your own sexual fantasies pale in comparison.
- Interestingly, research confirms that users’ problems correlate most closely with factors such as the number of screens opened (variety) and degree of arousal (that is, indications of addiction), not with time spent viewing online porn.
- Another risk of today’s online porn buffet is overconsumption.
- It’s also worth noting that videos replace imagination in a way that still images don’t. Left strictly to our imaginations we humans once tended to assume the starring role in our sexual fantasies, not the passive role of mere voyeur as in video-watching. However, some of those who start regular porn use very young are having a different experience: ‘Alien’ is the word I’d use to describe how it felt when I tried to have sex with real women. It felt artificial and foreign to me. It’s like I’ve gotten so conditioned to sitting in front of a screen jerking it, that my mind considers that to be normal sex instead of real actual sex.
- Most guys could not believe porn was the culprit behind their symptoms until months after they quit:
- For some, quitting triggered distressing, unexpected withdrawal symptoms:
- Most alarmingly of all, those with erectile dysfunction who quit porn often reported temporary, but absolute, loss of libido and abnormally lifeless genitals. Even men with no ED sometimes experienced temporary loss of libido and mild sexual dysfunctions soon after they quit:
- Unless guys had been warned about this ‘flatline’, fears of permanent impotence sent them rushing back to cyberspace to attempt to salvage their manhood.
- Many, however, were horrified to discover that they couldn’t override the flatline by returning to porn. They had to wait until their libido returned naturally – which sometimes took months.
- Psychologists and psychiatrists are typically trained to assume that certain symptoms indicate underlying pathologies, and that problematic overuse of a substance or behaviour is therefore a result of these disorders. Few healthcare providers are advised to consider that internet overuse can exacerbate those symptoms, or even cause reversible symptoms, which merely resemble those of underlying disorders (such as social anxiety, depression, apathy, severe concentration problems or performance anxiety). They risk incorrectly diagnosing patients as having underlying mental disorders and prescribing medications for them that, at best, temporarily mask their symptoms.
- In view of the importance of doing research that establishes the effects of porn by removing it, it is regrettable that only six studies in academic journals have called for porn use to be eliminated to assess its effects. All reported significant changes.
- Finally, in 2016 a European researcher reported preliminary results from a pioneering investigation of the effects of a period of porn and masturbation abstinence by NoFap’s Fapstronauts.[30] Results suggest that abstaining: increases the ability to delay rewards, renders people more willing to take risks, renders people more altruistic, and renders people more extroverted, more conscientious, and less neurotic. Taken together with the thousands of recovery self-reports in online forums, these studies demonstrate the importance of designing research that isolates the variable of internet porn use in order to demonstrate real-life effects on users.
- Researchers have been slow to inform the public that some populations are more at risk with respect to porn problems, such as adolescents, male digital natives and single porn users.
- ### Common Symptoms
- Although most early trials in giving up internet porn were desperate ploys to reverse deteriorating sexual function, today many people make the experiment in order to gain a whole range of benefits.
- Improvements since quitting: Social anxiety improved drastically – includes confidence, eye contact, comfort interacting, smoothness, etc. More energy in general Clearer, sharper mind, more concentration More vibrant looking face Depression alleviated Desire to interact with women Boners are back!!
- ### Interfering with life, losing control
- Inability to control use and use that interferes with one’s life are two cardinal signs of addiction. Priorities have shifted due to changes in the brain that we’ll look at later. In effect, life’s natural rewards, such as friendship, exercise and accomplishment, can no longer compete. Your brain now believes that IT – in this case internet porn use – is an important goal, and equates it with your survival:
- As mentioned, on most forums ED is the number-one motivation for eliminating porn.
- Between 1948 and 2002, historical rates of ED for men under 40 were consistently 2%–3% and did not begin to rise steeply until after age 40.[38],[39]40,41 However, since 2010, six studies have found ED rates of 14%–33% in young men, a 1000% increase in the last 15 years.[40]
- High rates of limp penises and low sexual desire in teenage males should make everyone take notice as being extremely surprising. Imagine how unheard of these conditions would be in young bulls and stallions. The sexologists who gathered the data for the adolescent study were ‘unclear’ why they found such high rates, and didn’t even mention internet porn overuse as a possible influence. Yet in my view, no other variable has changed in the last twenty years that could possibly account for a tremendous rise in youthful ED and low libido.
- Premature ejaculation from porn use may seem counterintuitive. Two possible explanations come to mind. Perhaps a guy has trained his nervous system to ejaculate very quickly (or while partially erect).
- For others porn may become a powerful trigger due to a strong association between porn and ejaculation. This automatic, high arousal response is similar to Pavlov’s dog salivating at the sound of a bell:
- Once upon a time, men could trust their penises to tell them everything they needed to know about their sexual tastes or orientation. That was before readily available porn videos.
- Brains are plastic. The truth is we are always training our brains – with or without our conscious participation. It’s clear from countless reports that it’s not uncommon for porn users to move from genre to genre, often arriving at places they find personally disturbing and confusing.
- A related reason porn tastes can escalate is tolerance, which is a more lasting addiction process that drives a need for greater stimulation.
- ### Loss of attraction to real partners
- ‘Young Japanese men are growing indifferent or even averse to sex, while married couples are starting to have it even less,’ reported the Japan Times, citing a 2010 poll that revealed a striking trend. More than 36% of men aged 16 to 19 had no interest in sex, more than double the 17.5% from 2008. Men between 20 and 24 showed a similar trend, jumping from 11.8% to 21.5%, while men between 45 and 49 leaped from 8.7% to 22.1%.
- In 2017, researchers reported that higher levels of porn use correlate with preferring porn over people for sexual excitement.
- ### Effects on romance
- Relationships, too, are affected by porn use, which makes sense. Too much stimulation can interfere with what scientists call pair-bonding, or falling in love. When scientists jacked up pair-bonding animals on amphetamine, the naturally monogamous animals no longer formed a preference for one partner.[67] Artificial, abnormally intense stimulation hijacks their bonding machinery, leaving them just like regular (promiscuous) mammals – in which the brain circuits for lasting bonds are muted.
- There are now over 70 studies, most fairly recent, linking internet porn use (or problematic porn use) to sexual problems, lower arousal to sexual stimuli and reduced sexual and relationship satisfaction.
- In fact, in men, higher porn consumption is consistently associated with reduced enjoyment of sexual intimacy with a partner.
- ### Social anxiety, self-esteem
- As users manage to abstain from porn, their desire to connect with others generally surges. Often, so does their self-esteem, their ability to look others in the eye, their sense of humour, their optimism, their attractiveness to potential mates, and so forth.
- In some cases it takes months, but for others the shift is so rapid that it catches them by surprise.
- YBOP wasn’t alone in chronicling this unexpected connection. In his famous TED talk “The Demise of Guys”, well known psychologist Phillip Zimbardo noted that ‘arousal addiction’ (porn, video games) is a major factor in the increase in social awkwardness and anxiety among digital natives.
- Zimbardo’s hypothesis is that excessive screen time can interfere with development of normal social skills. Already, ten studies link porn use to anxiety, with an eleventh linking it to shyness.
- ### Inability to concentrate
- Those who reboot commonly report that they have ‘better concentration’, ‘no more brain fog’, ‘clearer thinking’ and ‘improved memory’. Not surprisingly, researchers report that porn (or erotica) viewing is associated with concentration problems,[72] working memory interference,[73] poorer executive function,[74] and reduced academic performance.[75] Several research groups have now linked porn use with impulsiveness or the inability to delay gratification.
- ### Depression and Other Distress
- Scientists now view depression as a condition of low energy and little motivation. Recent research confirmed that the ‘go get it!’ neurochemical dopamine is the main player.[78] In fact, impaired/restored dopamine signalling may be behind many of the symptoms/improvements reported by recovering users.
- Almost a dozen studies now correlate porn use or problematic porn use with depression.
- ## 2 WANTING RUN AMOK
- Ever heard of the Coolidge effect? It’s a graphic example of how unrelentingly sexual novelty can drive behaviour. The effect shows up in mammals ranging from rams to rats, and here’s how it works: Drop a male rat into a cage with a receptive female rat. First, you see a frenzy of copulation. Then, progressively, the male tires of that particular female. Even if she wants more, he has had enough. However, replace the original female with a fresh one, and the male immediately revives and gallantly struggles to fertilize her. You can repeat this process with fresh females until he is completely wiped out. Reproduction, after all, is genes’ top priority.
- An appreciation for a fine novel partner helps propel internet porn use. At its most fundamental level, this impulse is evolution’s way of making sure no female goes unfertilized.
- What powers the lure of novelty at the physical level? Primitive circuits in the brain govern emotions, drives, impulses, and subconscious decision-making.
- The desire and motivation to pursue sex arise largely from the neurochemical called dopamine.[84] Dopamine amps up the centrepiece of a primitive part of the brain known as the reward circuitry. It’s where you experience cravings and pleasure and where you get addicted.
- The evolutionary purpose of dopamine is to motivate you to do what serves your genes.[86] The bigger the squirt the more you want or even crave something. No dopamine and you just ignore it.
- Although dopamine is sometimes referred to as the ‘pleasure molecule’, it is actually about seeking and searching[88] for pleasure, not pleasure itself. Thus dopamine rises with anticipation.
- The final reward, or what we experience as feelings of pleasure, involves the release of endogenous opioids. These morphine-like chemicals also bind to receptors within the reward circuit. The pleasure of climax appears to arise from a huge release of opioids.
- Think of dopamine as wanting and opioids as liking, although these functions are not so simplistically separated in the brain.
- Dopamine surges for novelty.
- The thrill fades away as dopamine plummets.
- Internet porn is especially enticing because novelty is always just a click away. It could be a novel ‘mate’, unusual scene, strange sexual act, or – you fill in the blank. Popular porn tube sites present dozens of different clips and genres on every page. They engross us with inexhaustible sexual novelty.
- With multiple tabs open, and clicking for hours, you can ‘experience’ more novel sex partners every ten minutes than your hunter-gatherer ancestors experienced in a lifetime.
- So what makes today’s porn uniquely compelling? Not just its unending novelty. Dopamine fires up for other emotions and stimuli too, all of which often feature prominently in internet porn:
- Surprise,[98] shock (What isn’t shocking in today’s porn?)
- Violation of expectations[99] (‘This genre is unlike anything I’ve ever seen.’)
- Anxiety[100] (Porn that’s inconsistent with your values or sexuality.)
- Seeking[101] and searching (Some scientists call the reward circuit the ‘seeking circuit’.)
- Many of these same emotional states (anxiety, shame, shock, surprise) not only elevate dopamine, but also boost stress hormones and neurotransmitters (norepinephrine, epinephrine, cortisol).
- Over time a porn user’s brain can mistake feelings of anxiety[103] or riskiness for feelings of sexual arousal.[104]
- In fact, internet porn looks very much like what scientists call a supernormal stimulus
- Years ago, Nobel laureate Nikolaas Tinbergen discovered that birds, butterflies, and other animals could be duped into preferring fake eggs and mates. Female birds, for example, struggled to sit on Tinbergen’s larger-than-life, vividly spotted plaster eggs while their own pale, dappled eggs perished untended. Male jewel beetles will ignore real mates in favour of futile efforts to copulate with the dimpled brown bottoms of beer bottles.[106]To a beetle, a beer bottle looks like the hottest female ever.
- In other words, instead of the instinctive response stopping at a ‘sweet spot’ where it doesn’t lure the animal out of the mating game entirely, this innate programming continues to trigger enthusiastic responses to unrealistic, synthetic stimuli.
- ### Sexual arousal and addictive drugs share neurological mechanisms
- Interestingly, research on rats shows that methamphetamine and cocaine hijack the same reward-centre nerve cells that evolved for sexual conditioning.
- Since orgasm is our most powerful natural reinforcer, and reproduction our genes’ top job, masturbating to streaming porn videos has no neurological equal. I say this because even people who agree that porn use can cause problems or even addiction, sometimes erroneously compare it to addictive drugs or videogames. Certainly, behavioural and substance addictions share some brain changes. Yet such analogies ignore the elephant in the room: Our brain circuits for sex are particularly vulnerable during adolescence (and somewhat vulnerable lifelong).
- Alcohol, cocaine and first-person shooters can all elevate reward centre dopamine (requisite for addiction-related brain changes), but unlike internet porn, none has the power to sculpt our extensive sex-and-reproduction brain circuitry or alter our sexual tastes.
- ## Overriding Normal Satisfaction
- A ‘binge mechanism’ is an evolutionary advantage in situations where survival is furthered by overriding satiation mechanisms (‘I’m full’, ‘I’m done’).
- Excess consumption of food or sex signals the brain that you have hit the evolutionary jackpot,[123] and a powerful neurochemical incentive to grab more kicks in.
- What’s a brain to do when it has unlimited access to a super-stimulating reward it never evolved to handle? Some brains adapt – and not in a good way. At first, using porn and masturbating to orgasm resolves sexual tension and registers as satisfying. But if you chronically over stimulate yourself, your brain may start to work against you.
- ## Both Sexual Conditioning and Addiction Begin with Sensitisation
- You have already learned that sexual arousal and addictive drugs (meth and cocaine) stimulate the same group of reward system nerve cells while triggering similar mechanisms that leave the user wanting more. So it’s not surprising that sexual conditioning (‘this is what turns me on’) and cravings to use drugs involve the same brain change: sensitisation.
- Spikes of dopamine set in motion the neurochemical events creating sensitisation,[125] but the actual molecular switch that produces sensitisation is the protein DeltaFosB.
- DeltaFosB’s job is to ensure you remember and repeat the activity. It does this by rewiring your brain to want whatever you have been bingeing on. A spiral can ensue in which wanting/craving leads to doing, doing triggers more surges of dopamine, dopamine causes DeltaFosB to accumulate – and the urge to repeat the behaviour gets stronger with each loop.
- Stored in nerve connections, these associations are called cues, or triggers, by addiction experts. Anything that activates these pathways grabs our attention by increasing reward circuit dopamine.
- When cues are activated sensitised neural pathways blast the reward circuit with a spike in electrical activity creating hard-to-ignore cravings to use. This all happens unconsciously. All you know is that you instantly have an overwhelming ‘need’ to view porn. It can feel like a matter of life and death, such that all your resolutions take flight.
- When an addict stops using, DeltaFosB slowly degrades and is back to normal levels about two months after the last binge. However, the sensitised pathways remain, perhaps for a lifetime. Remember, the purpose of DeltaFosB is to promote the rewiring of the brain so that you will experience a bigger blast from whatever you have been over consuming. This memory, or deeply ingrained learning, lingers long after the initiating events.
- ### The Brain Fights Back: A Double-Edged Sword
- As increased cravings compel the user to binge on porn, overstimulation of the reward circuitry leads to a localized rebellion. If DeltaFosB is the gas pedal for bingeing, the molecule CREB functions as the brakes. CREB dampens our pleasure response.[134] It inhibits dopamine. CREB is trying to take the joy out of bingeing so that you give it a rest.
- Oddly enough, high levels of dopamine stimulate the production of both CREB and DeltaFosB.
- Put simply, CREB doesn’t stand much chance in the era of supernormal stimuli and widely available prescription and illicit drugs.
- The numbed pleasure response induced by CREB is often called desensitisation. It leads to tolerance, which is ‘the need for a higher dose to achieve the same effect.’ Tolerance is a key feature of addiction, but can occur without developing all the brain changes seen in full-blown addiction.
- Nature plays a cruel joke. CREB’s attempt to suppress dopamine and endogenous opioids to urge ‘over indulgers’ to take a break works against a chronic porn user. Numbing his pleasure response can drive him to seek out more extreme material, often swiping from clip to clip in search of the one that will restore his dopamine levels. Put simply, CREB can lead to tolerance, which may result in compulsive porn use and escalation.
- You may be wondering how chronic overstimulation can induce two seemingly opposite effects. First, it can increase dopamine activity (sensitisation via DeltaFosB). Second, it can decrease dopamine activity (desensitisation via CREB124). The answer is that it’s mostly about timing. But it’s also about the neurological differences between wanting and liking.
- Sensitisation leads to high spikes of dopamine in response to cues and triggers associated with use. The dopamine spikes occur before ingesting the drug or masturbating to porn, and are experienced as cravings to use.
- Brain scan studies confirm that porn addicts have greater reward system activation in the craving phase (wanting), but do not like porn any more than non-addicts.
- ### Sexual Conditioning and Adolescence
- One outcome of chronic porn use is unanticipated sexual conditioning – which wasn’t likely in baby boomers using Playboy
- A millennial may easily wire his sexual excitement to a screen, constant novelty, voyeurism or bizarre acts. Worst case, he eventually needs both porn’s content and delivery-at-a-click to achieve an erection or sustain arousal.
- ### Getting Kinky
- Research on conditioning sexual response in humans is limited, but shows that sexual arousal is conditionable,[153] and particularly prior to adulthood.[154] For example, when males view porn at the same time they view unsexy items such as a black boot[155] or a jar of pennies[156] they later became aroused (and got erections) to the boot or the penny jar alone. No porn necessary.
- Sexual conditioning has shown up in three brain scan studies (fMRI), in which compulsive porn users viewed porn while researchers assessed brain activity. As expected, the compulsive porn users’ brain response mirrored what occurs in substance addicts (greater cue-reactivity, or sensitisation).
- Fortunately, brain plasticity also works the other way. I see many guys quit porn and, months later, realise that the fetishes they thought were indelible had faded away. Eventually, they can’t believe they once got off to X (and perhaps only to X).
- ## More on Porn-Induced Sexual Dysfunctions
- While only a few studies have documented men quitting porn to heal chronic sexual dysfunctions, 19 additional studies have linked sexual problems or lower arousal to porn use and porn addiction.
- Dopamine is odd. It shoots up when something is better than expected (violates expectations), but drops when expectations are not met.[163] With sex, it’s nearly impossible to match internet porn’s level of surprise, variety and novelty. Thus, once a young man thoroughly conditions himself to porn, sex may not meet his unconscious expectations. Unmet expectations produce a drop in dopamine – and erections.
- While sexual conditioning is the principal brain change responsible for porn-induced ED, it alone cannot account for all the symptoms men experience. Two of the most common, yet hard to explain, symptoms are the loss of morning wood (nocturnal erections) and the dreaded flatline.
- The absence of nocturnal erections generally occurs prior to quitting porn. It’s important to note that urologists often use the absence of nocturnal erections to distinguish psychological ED from organic ED (i.e. blood vessel or nerve problems). It’s possible that some men with porn-induced ED, accompanied by no morning wood, are incorrectly diagnosed as having organic ED. In contrast, the temporary flatline occurs after eliminating porn use. It typically manifests as lifeless genitals, no libido and the loss of attraction to real people.
- What do guys who successfully recover from porn-induced ED suggest? Suggestion number one is to eliminate porn, porn substitutes, and recalling the porn you watched. Or to put it another way, eliminate all artificial sexual stimulation.
- If it’s not real life, just say ‘no’.
- The second suggestion is to rewire your sexual arousal to real people.
- Pornography Addiction
- Researchers know that all addictions, despite their differences, bring about an established set of core brain changes.
- the ‘Three Cs’: craving and preoccupation with obtaining, engaging in or recovering from the use of the substance or behaviour; loss of control in using the substance or engaging in the behaviour with increasing frequency or duration, larger amounts or intensity, or in increasing the risk in use and behaviour to obtain the desired effect; and negative consequences in physical, social, occupational, financial or psychological domains.
- So, what are the four fundamental brain changes addiction appears to cause? In simple, very broad, terms they are 1) Sensitisation, 2) Desensitisation, 3) Dysfunctional prefrontal circuitry (hypofrontality), and 4) Malfunctioning stress system. Studies on porn users/sex addicts now find evidence of each of these changes.
- 1. Sensitisation or an unconscious super-memory of pleasure which, when activated, triggers powerful cravings.
- 2. Desensitisation or a numbed response to pleasure.
- 3. Dysfunctional prefrontal circuitry manifests as weakened willpower combined with hyper-reactivity to addiction cues.
- To help us control impulses the prefrontal cortex extends two types of nerve pathways into our reward system: ‘go for it’ pathways and ‘let’s stop and think about it’ pathways. These pathways function as a gas pedal and brakes for the less reflective reward system.
- With addiction the increasingly powerful ‘go get it’ pathways amplify cravings to use porn, while the physiologically weakened ‘think about it’ pathways have a harder time inhibiting your drives. It’s the neurological equivalent of a devil on one shoulder and an angel on the other – with the devil resembling King Kong.
- 4. Malfunctioning stress system manifests as amplified cravings, inhibited willpower, and myriad withdrawal symptoms.
- Some experts view addiction as a stress disorder because it not only affects circulating stress hormones (cortisol and adrenaline), but also induces multiple alterations in the brain’s stress system.
- Three of these alterations make it very challenging to quit.
- First, stress increases dopamine and cortisol, turning even minor stressors into severe cravings.
- Second, stress inhibits the prefrontal cortex and executive function, including impulse control and the ability to fully comprehend the consequences of our actions.
- Last but not least, when an addict deprives his brain of its fix, his stress system goes into overdrive. It induces many of the common withdrawal symptoms reported by addicts, such as anxiety, depression, tiredness, insomnia,
- To date, three studies have demonstrated dysfunctional stress systems in porn users/sex addicts.
- However, in the forums I monitor ex-porn users regularly report surprisingly severe withdrawal symptoms that are reminiscent of drug withdrawals: insomnia, anxiety, irritability, mood swings, headaches, restlessness, poor concentration, fatigue, depression, social paralysis and the sudden loss of libido that guys call the ‘flatline’ (apparently unique to porn withdrawal).
- ### But ‘Porn Addiction’ Isn’t Recognized, Right?
- ### When Does One Cross the Line?
- Many ask the obvious question: ‘How much is too much?’ This question presumes that porn’s effects are binary.
- The takeaway is that addiction is not required for measurable brain changes or negative effects.
- This is why questions such as ‘Does this visual count as porn?’ or ‘How much porn use causes an addiction?’ are misguided. The former is like asking whether it’s slot machines or blackjack that leads to a gambling addiction. The latter is like asking a food addict how many minutes she spends eating. The fact is, the brain’s reward centre doesn’t know what porn is. It only registers levels of stimulation through dopamine and opioid spikes.
- ### Isolating Cause and Effect
- ### Are Some Porn Users Misdiagnosed?
- Although symptoms such as erectile dysfunction, social anxiety, concentration problems and depression are quite different, they share a common finding in the scientific literature. As explained, one brain change that occurs is desensitisation. Again, this term refers to a general dialling down of a person’s responsiveness to all pleasure – a baseline drop in dopamine and reduced dopamine sensitivity.
- The flipside is that when dopamine and related neurochemicals are properly regulated, sexual attraction, socializing, concentration, sexual responsiveness, and feelings of wellbeing are more effortless.
- Again, preliminary results show that a four-week period of abstinence from porn left people more willing to take risks, more extroverted, more conscientious, more altruistic, more able to delay gratification and less neurotic.
- ## 3 REGAINING CONTROL
- The first step toward regaining control is to give your brain a rest from all artificial sexual stimulation for several months. Shift your attention to real life. Among other things, this will help you establish whether chronic overconsumption of pornography, or some other issue, is underlying your symptoms.
- Ideally, an extended time-out also allows you to: restore the sensitivity of your brain’s reward circuitry so you can again enjoy everyday pleasures, reduce the intensity of the ‘gotta have it!’ brain pathways that drive you to use, re-establish your willpower (strengthen the brain’s prefrontal cortex), and reduce the impact of stress such that it doesn’t set off severe cravings.
- Next, you stay consistent because it can take many months, or even a couple of years, for the ‘I want to watch porn right now!’ pathways to fire less frequently – and then die down. Some people call this process ‘rebooting’.
- Through trial and error, rebooters have discovered that surfing Facebook, dating apps or erotic services sites for images is like an alcoholic switching to lite beer: counterproductive. In short, artificial sexual stimulation includes anything your brain might use in the way it has been using porn: cam2cam erotic encounters, sexting, reading erotica, friendfinder apps, fantasizing about porn scenarios ... you get the idea.
- The goal now is to seek your pleasure from interacting with real people without a screen between you, and awaken your appetite for life and love.
- ## Recommended Suggestions
- ### Managing access
- Remove all porn
- Delete all porn from your devices. It can be a wrench, but this action sends your brain the signal that your intention to change is ironclad.
- Move your furniture around
- Environmental cues associated with use can be powerful triggers because they fire up sensitised pathways. Drug addicts are told to avoid friends, neighbourhoods and activities associated with previous use. You can’t avoid yourself or move, but you can make some changes, and then take care not to use porn in the new configuration.
- Consider a porn blocker and an ad blocker
- Porn blockers are not fail-proof. They are like speed-bumps. They give you time to realize that you’re about to do what you really don’t want to do. Early in recovery, before your self-control is restored, blockers can be quite helpful. Eventually, you won’t need them.
- highly recommend OpenDNS or some other kind of web filtering service, especially if it comes with a 3-minute delay before new settings take effect. That way, even if you falter, the 3 minutes give you enough time to realize you really don’t want to do this, and unset those settings.
- Consider a day-counter
- Various forums offer free day-counters. Beneath your posts a bar graph shows your progress to your goal, and it updates automatically. Some people find it very satisfying to track their progress visually.
- Ultimately, what matters is not days but brain balance. Brains do not all return to balance on a set schedule, and while brains definitely need time to reboot, accumulated days aren’t the whole story. Brain balance also benefits from exercise, socializing, time in nature, increased self-control, better self-care, meditation, and so forth.
- Extinction training (not for everyone)
- Remember Pavlov’s dog? You may not realize it, but Pavlov didn’t just teach his dog to salivate at the sound of a bell. He later taught it to stop salivating to the bell by ringing the bell and then withholding meat (repeatedly). This process is known as ‘cue extinction’. You weaken the link or pathway between a stimulus and a habitual response.
- ### Support
- Join a forum, get an accountability partner
- Involvement in an online community where others are experimenting with giving up porn can inspire you, give you a place to rant, supply the good feelings that come from supporting others, and generate new tips for speeding progress:
- Sites such as NoFap.com and Reboot Nation facilitate finding accountability partners.
- Therapy, support groups, healthcare
- Keep a journal
- Keep a record of your progress. Rebooting is not a linear process. There are good days and bad days, and on the bad days your brain will try to persuade you that you have made no progress and never will. Reading earlier entries from your journal can swiftly put things back in perspective:
- ### Managing Stress, Improving Self-control and Self-care
- Exercise, beneficial stressors
- Of all the techniques rebooters experiment with, exercise seems to be the most universally beneficial. It’s an excellent distraction from urges, improves self-confidence and fitness, and is even associated with better erectile function in men under 40.
- Exercise is a solid mood regulator. Scientists surmise that it can help ease addiction because acute bouts of exercise increase dopamine concentrations, and regular exercise leads to sustained increases in dopamine and related adjustments.[230] This helps counteract the chronically low dopamine signalling that haunts recovering addicts before their brains reboot.
- Visit www.gettingstronger.org for the physiology behind exercise, intermittent fasting, daily cold showers, and so forth.
- The latter were once laughed off as a mainstay of Victorian theorists of manliness, but daily cold showers get rave reviews from many who seek a quick route to restoring lost willpower and emotional equilibrium. Cold showers have even been proposed as a medical treatment for depression.
- Get outside
- Researchers have found that time in nature is good for the brain. It boosts creativity, insight and problem solving.
- Socializing
- Humans evolved as tribal, pair-bonding primates. Our brains cannot easily regulate mood on their own, at least not for long. It’s not unusual to feel anxious or depressed (or self-medicate with an addiction) when isolated.
- By the same token, connection is some of the best health insurance the planet offers. It helps reduce the hormone cortisol, which can otherwise weaken the immune system under stress.
- When recovering users force their attention away from their habitual ‘relief ’, their reward circuitry looks around for other sources of pleasure. Eventually it finds the natural rewards it evolved to find: friendly interaction, real mates, time in nature, exercise, accomplishment, creativity, and so forth. All ease cravings.
- Whatever you choose, practice eye-contact with those you pass. Start with older people. Make a game of it. See if you can improve your score each time. Add a smile, nod or verbal greeting, until your natural charisma kicks in automatically.
- Meditation, relaxation techniques
- Daily meditation can be very soothing for anyone struggling with the stress of withdrawal. Research also shows that it helps the rational part, the prefrontal cortex, to stay in command.
- Creative pursuits, hobbies, life purpose
- The first few weeks are primarily a battle of distraction.
- Your brain will thank you. And, just like learning new things, creativity is both a great distraction and inherently rewarding because of the anticipation of achieving something important:
- I’m a writer and musician, though I have let my art fall by the wayside over the past few years as I retreated into porn. I thought that I was dealing with writer’s block because I could not allow myself to put words on paper or notes on strings. Since I started this journey, however, I am working on three songs with a fourth starting to work its way out of me.
- Steer for activities that produce lasting, sustainable satisfaction even if they aren’t as rewarding in the short-run: having a good conversation, organizing your work space, receiving/giving a cuddle, goal-setting, visiting someone, building something or gardening. In short, anything that gives you a sense of connection or moves you toward longer-term objectives.
- A powerful distraction like internet porn can be a form of self-medication for boredom, frustration, stress or loneliness.
- The better you feel, the less you need to self-medicate.
- Getting fit and learning to eat healthily are a start.
- ## Attitude, Education and Inspiration
- Be gentle with yourself
- Those who reboot with relative ease keep a sense of humour, accept their humanness, love sex but respect their sexuality, and gradually steer themselves into a new groove. They don’t bludgeon themselves, or threaten themselves with doom.
- Sex is a fundamental drive, and giving up the intense stimulation of regular porn use is a big shift for your brain. Ease your way through the transition, forgive yourself if you slip (but try to avoid bingeing), and keep going.
- Learn more about what’s going on in your brain
- Whether rebooters know a lot or a little about science, they generally value learning how they got where they are and how to change course:
- The site I created, www.yourbrainonporn is a clearing house for relevant science.
- Keep yourself inspired
- Rebooting can be a mighty challenge, and it helps to find a well of inspiration to draw from on a regular, even daily, basis.
- ## Rebooting Challenges
- Withdrawal
- Perhaps because our culture has been slow to acknowledge the honest-to-goodness physical addictiveness of today’s pornography, the severity of withdrawal symptoms can catch those who quit by surprise.
- In all addictions terminating use can prompt very real neurochemical events. Typically, these include an exaggerated stress response and a powerful sense that the world is hopelessly grey and meaningless in the absence of the missing stimulus. The first two weeks are often the toughest:
- Mood swings are often the first sign that something is shifting:
- Another frustrating thing about withdrawal symptoms is that recovery isn’t linear; it’s up and down. Some people only experience acute withdrawal symptoms during the first two or three weeks. Others still have sporadic withdrawal symptoms for months, informally dubbed ‘Post-Acute Withdrawal Syndrome’, or PAWS.
- Good days gradually become more frequent, but bad days continue for a long while before the brain is really back to normal.
- Flatline
- One young man described the flatline as ‘the gruelling, mysterious initiation one endures but never speaks of.’ It’s a standard withdrawal symptom in guys with porn-induced erectile dysfunction, but it also happens to some who don’t have ED at the time they quit.
- Insomnia
- It’s important to stay well rested as fatigue can trigger porn use. However, many rebooters have relied on their porn ritual as a sleep-aid for years. Without it, sleep is elusive at first. (Insomnia is a standard addiction withdrawal symptom.)
- Some guys have benefitted from supplements, herbal teas, such as camomile, and other home remedies.
- Triggers
- One man described triggers as, ‘the external factors that make you think about porn.’ Common triggers include: TV and movies with erotic content, porn flashbacks, morning wood, use of recreational drugs or alcohol, words that remind you of a porn site/actor and suggestive ads.
- But states of mind can also be triggers: boredom, anxiety, stress, depression, loneliness, rejection, fatigue, frustration, anger, failure, feeling sorry for yourself, desire to reward yourself for an accomplishment, overconfidence, jealousy, and being hung-over.
- Triggers are both problems and solutions. They can drive you mad during rebooting (at first), but they also show you when to be on high alert. Some rebooters take the drastic measure of unhooking from the internet for a month or two.
- You will need to be mindful of triggers for a long time, so it pays to work out what they are and be attentive. You also need to have a predetermined response for when you face one.
- When you feel The Urge, ask yourself: What emotions am I feeling? What time is it? Who else is around? What did I just do? Where am I? What could I do instead that would meet my needs?
- If you consistently ‘face and replace’, your new behaviour will eventually be automatic.
- Emotions
- Chaser
- Disturbing dreams, flashbacks
- People often remark that they recall their dreams better after quitting.
- Vivid dreams seem to be a normal part of the mental housecleaning process of unhooking. Often people dream they are relapsing as the brain tries to activate familiar brain loops, but eventually such dreams fade.
- Best to treat flashbacks like dreams. That is, regard them as mental housecleaning rather than evidence that the reboot isn’t working.
- Shame cycle
- Many of today’s internet porn users grew up with online erotica and are quite blasé about its use. If they feel shame, it’s about their inability to control use, not about porn content or use. Their shame evaporates as they regain control.
- Interestingly, people (including religious ones) on the forums we monitor often make rapid progress in rebooting after they re-frame their porn challenge in biological terms:
- Intermittent use
- The risks of very frequent porn use are familiar to many users. Less well known is the fact that intermittent use (for example, two hours of porn bingeing followed by a few weeks of abstinence, rinse and repeat) can increase compulsion to use. The reasons are biological and there is much addiction research on intermittent use, including studies involving drug224 and junk food use.[240] Periods of abstinence (2 to 4 weeks) lead to neuroplastic changes[241] that don’t occur in other users. These alterations increase cravings, heighten stress responses[242] and can produce severe withdrawal symptoms.[243] So, bingeing after interims of abstinence can hit you harder, perhaps because of the heightened intensity of the experience.[244] In short, intermittent bingeing can do the same thing as continuous use, and in some cases do more.
- ### Common Pitfalls
- Edging
- Edging is masturbating up to the edge of orgasm, repeatedly, without climaxing (often while browsing porn). This practice is not uncommon on ‘nofap’ forums where people sometimes persuade themselves that avoiding ejaculation is the issue and porn use is not.
- In men, edging stresses the prostate. Also, it does not prepare you well for sex with a real person, as it’s typically tied to prolonged visual stimulation, rapid-fire novelty, clicking from scene to scene, and your own hand (or sex toy). Dopamine is at its peak on the verge of orgasm. Therefore edging also keeps dopamine as high as it can naturally go, perhaps for hours.
- Fantasising
- Research on mental imagery indicates that fantasising or imagining an experience activates many of the same neural circuits as performing it.
- Most people report that avoiding fantasy early in a reboot is very helpful – including during sex with a partner – because it reduces cravings.
- Using porn substitutes
- This is another easy way to derail your reboot. If you’re trying to quit porn, it’s easy to rationalize looking at, say, pictures of models in thongs instead. After all, that’s not porn, right? Actually, the primitive part of your brain doesn’t know what porn is. It simply knows whether something is arousing (to you) or not.
- Internet porn addiction is not an addiction to the naked or erotic; it’s an addiction to screen novelty.
- Forcing sexual performance prematurely (ED)
- Traditionally, both men and women assumed that turning up the heat is the solution to sexual sluggishness in a partner. However, those with porn-related sexual dysfunction often find that they heal faster if they allow their libido to reawaken naturally, free of sexual performance demands.
- If orgasm sets off noticeable neurochemical ripples (the chaser) or sends you into a binge, don’t push yourself to finish for a while. Keep your sexual activity gentle and low-key, that is, free of all performance pressure, while your sensitivity to pleasure returns naturally. It is better to leave wanting more than to exhaust your sexual desire.
- The bad urge
- The ideal time to deal with a bad urge is before it shows up. When you first quit, plan ahead:
- Make a list (now) of reasons you are avoiding porn and consult it when The Urge arises. Better yet, write a note to yourself that you can read when The Urge arrives:
- Next, make a list of what you will do instead when The Urge arises.
- Some people use the ‘Red X’ technique: I totally stopped fantasising about porn about four weeks ago. Whenever a porn flashback enters my mind I visualise a big red X over it and imagine a loud ambulance siren. If the porn image is insistent, I visualise exploding it in my head. The key is to do it immediately. The technique becomes more automatic with time.
- If you don’t know what else to do, wait and do nothing. Think to yourself, ‘Here are cravings. They came out of nowhere and they have no real power over me. I am not my thoughts; I did not summon them; I do not want them; and I do not have to act on them.’
- Do you keep giving yourself an excuse like ‘I will do it one last time’ or ‘Today is the last time’? Change it to ‘Just today I am not doing it’.
- ### Common Questions
- How long should I reboot?
- In fact, YBOP suggests no set period, as the time needed is dependent on the severity of your porn-related problems, how your brain responds, and your goals. Time frames in rebooting accounts are all over the place because brains are different, and some men have stubborn porn-induced ED or DE. Think of a reboot as discovering what is really you and what was porn-related, whether it be sexual dysfunctions, social anxiety, raging horniness, ADD, depression, or whatever.
- Can I have sex during my reboot?
- It’s up to you. Some people find a temporary time-out from all sexual stimulation gives the brain a much needed rest and speeds recovery. On the other hand, daily affectionate touch is always beneficial, with or without sex.
- Should I eliminate masturbation while rebooting?
- Not necessarily. You can try cutting out porn, porn fantasy and porn substitutes first. For some people that is enough to allow a return to balance. Others find that masturbation is a powerful trigger for activating porn pathways, so they do better if they give it a rest for a while.
- For example, you don’t generally break a leg by putting weight on it. However, once it’s broken you have to cast it, use crutches and eliminate walking while you heal. Same goes for porn-induced ED. You don’t have to wear a cast, but you need to give your brain time to heal, free of intense sexual stimulation.
- How do I know when I’m back to normal?
- Obviously, there’s no simple answer to this question as goals differ for each person. Common goals include: return of healthy erections, ease of orgasm during partnered sex, normalizing libido, diminishing porn-induced fetish tastes, managing cravings, and so forth.
- How do I know that I don’t just have a high libido?
- Give up porn and porn fantasy and see what your libido is like some weeks later.
- ## CONCLUDING REFLECTIONS
- If you suspect your porn use might be adversely affecting you, by all means make a simple experiment: Give it up for a time and see what you notice for yourself.
- Quitting internet porn is the equivalent of removing refined sugar or trans-fats from your diet. It is simply the elimination of a form of entertainment that no one had until recently, and everyone got along without.
- Understand the Science of Misinformation
- If you’re wondering why there’s not yet a consensus on the effects of internet porn despite the swell of warnings from those affected and their healthcare givers, you may find the history of the Tobacco Wars instructive.
- Big Tobacco’s campaign to cast doubt on the link between smoking and disease is now a classic case study in a science called agnotology: the study of the cultural production of ignorance. Agnotology investigates the deliberate sowing of public misinformation and doubt in a scientific area.
- ### The Rearguard Strikes Back
- As always with a new field of science, progress has also elicited a degree of vocal resistance from the rearguard. The media and ‘sex-positive’ sexologists regularly characterise efforts to understand and explain the potential effects of internet porn on users as either attempts to pathologise diverse sexual behaviour or sexual shaming, claims that distract us all from the scientific evidence.
- ### Education – But What Kind and By Whom?
- So what do we do to prepare (potential) porn users so, like smokers, they can make informed choices? Perhaps you’ve heard that education is the solution. I agree, but such education needs to be done by experts trained in relevant brain science. Consumers need to be aware of the symptoms that today’s internet porn users are reporting, as well as how the brain learns, how chronic overconsumption can alter it for the worse (sexual conditioning, addiction), and what is entailed in reversing unwanted brain changes.
- People also need to know that reward-circuitry balance is indispensable for lifelong emotional, physical and mental wellbeing because of its power to shape our perceptions and priorities without our conscious awareness. And to be informed of methods that help humans steer for balance in the reward circuitry: exercise and other beneficial stressors, time in nature, companionship, healthy relationships, meditation and so on.

  No-code tools that enable workers to built bots that automate menial parts of their roles will be huge

  Co-working, subscription clubs, will emerge that let workers who prefer that mode of work to operate from there

  ~90% of the workforces we've spoken to never want to be in an office again full-time
- ✍️Written over spoken: documentation is the unspoken superpower of remote teams. The most successful team members remotely will be great writers
  Companies are searching for ways to do this more effectively. Tools that enable others to write better will explode

- How to learn to write:
  First, stop comparing your first draft to anyone’s published masterwork. 
  That stuff’s been written, rewritten, reviewed, copy edited, line edited, and more. Let them inspire you, but not demotivate you.
- Instead, compare your unpublished words to your peers’ unpublished words. You'll start to notice mistakes in their work that you missed (and can now fix) in your own.
  The best way to do this is to start a writing group and meet regularly.
- To collect feedback, I prefer the ABCD framework:
  - What’s Amazing?
  - What’s Boring?
  - What’s Confusing?
  - What Didn’t you believe?
  Beyond the feedback, a writing group can also keep you going when you would have otherwise given up.
- Every feedback session produces a list of “bugs” to address before the next round of feedback.
  Once you've run out of bugs, you can hit "publish" and start working on something new!
  And every once in a while, you'll write something great.

- The 10 Paradoxes of Entrepreneurship by @fortelabs
  1. Entrepreneurship is hard because it requires someone with a strong command of reason, who is at the same time thoroughly unreasonable.
- 2. Entrepreneurship is hard because it requires an abundance mindset toward the environment, and at the same time, a scarcity mindset toward the business.
- 3. Entrepreneurship is hard because it requires extreme vigilance of what competitors are doing, without being too influenced by them.
- 4. Entrepreneurship is hard because you have no idea what youâ€™re doing, but at the same time know exactly what youâ€™re doing.
- 5. Entrepreneurship is hard because it requires a willingness to go far out of balance, without completely losing control.
- 6. Entrepreneurship is hard because it requires being rigid where others are flexible, and flexible where others are rigid.
- 7. Entrepreneurship is hard because you have to not believe in tradeoffs, yet be constantly making them.
- 8. Entrepreneurship is hard because it requires caring deeply what others think about your product, while not caring at all what they think about you.
- 9. Entrepreneurship is hard because it requires you to be highly ambitious, yet not preoccupied with the inevitable failures it brings.
- 10. Entrepreneurship is hard because you have to always do what you say youâ€™re going to do, and also consistently say youâ€™ll do impossible things.

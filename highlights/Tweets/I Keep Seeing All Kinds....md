- I keep seeing all kinds of crazy reports about people's experiences with GPT-3, so I figured that I'd collect a thread of them.
- First, @gwern 's crazy collection of all kinds of prompts, with GPT-3 generating poetry, summarizing stories, rewriting things in different styles, and much much more. https://t.co/VQ1PX9rzeY
- Automatic code generation from natural language descriptions. "Give me a page with a table showing the GDP of different nations, and a red button." https://t.co/t7emUkv2Qm
- Taking a brief technical tweet about GPT-3 and expanding it to an essay which the author of the original tweet mostly endorses. https://t.co/ffEInK9ms8
- Acting as a more intense therapist than ELIZA ever was. https://t.co/sLb1LDk6VZ
- On the side of "it does still have weaknesses too", figuring out how to trick it at the Turing Test. https://t.co/8Z2CaxtIYA
- Also, using the architecture behind it to generate images. https://t.co/AbH5G80RBV
- Redditor shares an "AI Dungeon" game played with the new GPT-3 -based "dragon model", involving a cohesive story generated in response to their actions, with only a little manual editing. https://t.co/io3jW7sgJm
- The official announcement of the Dragon Model and examples. "The game invents a complex magic system and underlying theory behind why it works and describes the whole system as I read the book."

- Another example of automatically generated code, this time giving GPT-3 a bit of React code defining a component called "ThreeButtonComponent" or "HeaderComponent", and letting it write the rest.

- From a brief description, GPT-3 correctly generates an explanation indicating that it's a case of asthma, mentions a drug that's used to treat asthma, the type of receptor the drug works on, and which multiple-choice quiz question this indicates.

- GPT-3 tries to get a software job. https://t.co/qTj3XX1BUy
- Translating natural language descriptions into shell commands, and vice versa. https://t.co/I9IsD2yJdb
- Given a prompt with a few lines of dialogue, GPT-3 continues the story, incorporating details such as having a character make 1800s references after it was briefly mentioned that she's a nineteenth-century noblewoman.

- . @bioothod noted that not *all* of GPT-3's answers are that great. Fair. IMO, being able to produce good answers even *with* human selection is amazing by itself, and often it requires relatively little, but yeah it's not a general intelligence yet.

- So far I had only been sharing other people's experiences, which did occasionally make me wonder whether they're all real. Now I tried out GPT-3 myself, to generate some space opera. And whoa. Yeah I believe that they're real now. https://t.co/j2FdtR8Nq1

### Highlights

- I listened to @david_perell & @patio11 talk and found a slogan for the soundtrack of understanding media.
  Incentive Structures Rules Everything Around Me (I.S.R.E.A.M) get the money Dolla, Dolla Bill yall or "Why You Should Become Internet Famous"
  Here are my main takeaways üëáüèæ
- Be cautious of taking advice from people/companies whose incentive model for writing is optimized on their advertising revenue with shallow, short & reactionary writing.
  There's a market & audience for high quality long-form content that operates on different incentives.
- Video games are a permission-less container for experimental strategies, building skills & studying incentives to train you in identifying and working with optimal incentives in the real world.
- The internet enables permission-less writing and has luck programmed in similar to video games.
- You can increase your chances of being interesting, discoverable and valuable by writing in public & about intersections of multiple domains with you acting as a translator & bridge for your audience.
- Write before your words have a destination for an audience or specific person. 
  Build your writing inventory before you need it, so it's easier to ship in the future.
- Think about how your output will be perceived by the user. 
  Produce high-value, low-cost bundles of output with intentional word & image choice & make the structure of your content appealing for added quality perception.
- Building an email list is underrated on social media.
  Owning an email empowers you to be the primary custodian of the relationship with your audience.
  Using platforms you don't own is renting access for the privilege of speaking to your audience. Own your conversational house.
- When you have a conversation over email you can frame the conversation & speak in a quiet room that you both can focus. 
  When you have a conversation on forums, social media etc, it's like have a conversation in a loud bar with a high chance of disruption & distraction.
- Reduce the cost & upfront investment you need to share your ideas.
  In consulting, this is the spectrum of Coffee Chats vs Deliverables Handoff.
  Twitter, Forums, Communities, and Email are your coffee chat low-cost environment to build your ideas over time.
- Get good at something. 
  Remix ideas & domains. 
  Find a process that works for you.
  Own your own career advancement. 
  Communicate progress before you‚Äôre ready.
- Working with smart people is an effective way to increase your luck and reduce your cost of learning.
- A company can hire for certain traits like ambition & optimism which creates a viral environment for those traits in future hires. 
  It creates a feedback loop that can be amplified by technology + systems and spread through the company with an internal writing culture.
- Cultivate Obsession Driven Writing, where your curiosity is too overwhelming to keep to yourself and your intellectual sessions become a catalyst for more writing shared publicly.
- You only need to be internet famous to the people that matter, value and respect you in an incentive environment where you value and respect your audience.
- Writing is an effective way to build an audience & or a product through creating & building value, authority, and open communication creating Writer Audience Fit. 
  Your audience will even reveal common problems they share & you can build solutions w/ early Product Market Fit.

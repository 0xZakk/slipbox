- Charlie Munger: "We're having a recession .... 
  the only question is how big it's going to be and how long it's going to last ... 
  I don’t think we’ll have a long-lasting Great Depression. I think government will be so active that we won’t have one like that."
- "... we may have a different kind of a mess. All this money-printing may start bothering us.
  I do think ... we’ll have an economy back, which will be a moderate economy. It’s quite possible that never again will we have a level of employment again like we just lost."
- This will cause us to shutter some businesses. We have a few bad businesses that ... we could be tolerant of as members of the family. Somebody else would have already shut them down. We’ve got a few businesses, small ones, we won’t reopen when this is over.”
- “I don’t have the faintest idea whether the stock market is going to go lower than the old lows or whether it’s not. The coronavirus shutdown is “something we have to live through,” letting the chips fall where they may, What else can you do?"
- I believe these were the first public comments coming from Berkshire since the Coronavirus.

- How to be happy (without getting lucky):
- Learn your true preferences. Knowing what you dislike tends to be more reliable than what you think you'll like.
- Try new things, but always keep a realistic option to quit. If you're on the wrong train, every stop is the wrong stop.
- Treat your life as an adventure, not a competition. A good life is a story you're proud of. There's no score.
- Happiness is about getting in the flow. For most things, go with intensity over consistency. Balance your life at the macro level, not the micro.
- Remove as much accountability from your life as you can. Chose what you want to be responsible for very rigorously.
- The best things in life are free, and they're not worth sacrificing for the possibility of the getting the second best things.
- As soon as you can afford to, optimize your life for maximum enjoyment. The deferred lifestyle is too risky.
- As soon as you can afford to, work on what gives you most energy. Only intrinsic motivation lasts.
- Procrastination is information. Don't fight it, embrace it.
- Never risk anything you can't tolerate losing. Be very rigorous about what goes in that group.
- Decouple your self-worth from anything you don't control.
- Understand that the only thing you truly control is your behavior (how you react to things). Live with dignity.
- Do not play victim. Do not complain.
- Add excitement to your life, not expectations. Happiness is governed by expectations, not outcomes.

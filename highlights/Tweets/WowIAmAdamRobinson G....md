- Wow!
  @IAmAdamRobinson gives the most holistic answer I have ever heard to the "What advice would you give to a college graduate?" question.

  Some snippets below ðŸ‘‡
- "Youâ€™re leaving a game youâ€™ve played since at least first grade with a rule book youâ€™ve consciously, if not unconsciously, assimilated, and more or less mastered for an entirely new game with no formal rule book handed out. Youâ€™ll have to write your own rule book."
- "Youâ€™d think the point of education would be to prepare you for the real world, but the real world is more unlike school than like it."
- "Adopt an experimental attitude towards everything, continually testing what works for you and what doesnâ€™t."
- "You wonâ€™t receive a clear course syllabus every few months detailing the assignments and exactly what is expected of you, and the standards by which a single person, your professor, will evaluate your work and award you a single-letter grade."
- "Youâ€™ll be interacting with a broad spectrum of humanity in all of its delightful, but sometimes challenging, diversity. So, youâ€™ll need to acquire a whole new set of people skills and ways to relate to others and cultivate whatâ€™s known as emotional intelligence."
- "Whatever youâ€™re doing for work, whatever, throw yourself into it wholeheartedly even if you realize itâ€™s a transitional gig while you search for something better."
- "You can be doing every right, paying your dues, and for months or years it seems like youâ€™re not making any progress, and then all of a sudden, boom!"
- "Find out what you love to do and do best, and cultivate that talent or talents. Then, be relentless in finding jobs or situations in which those strengths and passions are most in demand."
- "The most important gifts and goals in life, including love, success, and happiness, are never achieved â€“ I want to underscore that â€“ never achieved by pursuing them directly."

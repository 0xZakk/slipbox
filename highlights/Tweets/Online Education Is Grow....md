- Online education is growing fast.
  This thread is like an Industry 101 course: 
  1. It's harder to sell a course than build one: The top online schools are run by people with the largest audiences, not necessarily the best teachers. But building an audience trains you to teach.
- 2. Teaching follows a power law.
  Like most of the Internet, there are disproportionate returns to being the best. In public schools, even the best teachers have no more than 100 students at a time. Online, the best teachers can have thousands of students.
- 3. In online education, there can be increasing returns to scale.
  Colleges tout the benefits of small classrooms because big class sizes tend to harm the student experience. In online courses, depending on the subject, class sizes in the 1000s can enhance the student experience.
- 4. Come for the course, stay for the community.
  Having 1000s of people in a live session at once doesn't hurt the student experience, but accepting non-serious participants does. Community strength — not information — differentiates most high-end schools.

- 5. Online education brands are built around courses, not schools.
  When people talk about traditional education, they talk about schools like Harvard and Yale. But when they talk about online education, they talk about individual courses like AltMBA and Building a Second Brain.
- 6. Online schools exist on a spectrum between performance marketing and brand marketing.
  Every school prioritizes either short-term sales or long-term brand building. The industry's scammy reputation comes from the creators who prioritize performance over brand.

- 7. Learning is active, education is passive
  Until now, most online education has been a passive experience with pre-recorded videos and little student-to-student interaction. For active learning schools, community building will become an essential skill.

- 8. Teaching online demands many skills.
  None of these skills are hard to learn, but many are inversely correlated with each other so good online teachers are a rare breed. Those skills fall into four buckets: (1) business, (2) marketing, (3) entertainment, and (4) education. https://t.co/dbBCeVmMm7
- 9. Online learning demands new research.
  It's no coincidence that many of the top online teachers have never taught in a real classroom. Teaching online demands a different skillset. Since the experience is so different, traditional pedagogy isn't helpful for online educators.
- 10. Entertainment and education
  If online educators have a core insight, it's that entertainment and education are symbiotic. Most of my teachers saw them as opposites. They made learning a boring and uneventful endeavor. If online teachers do that, they'll go out of business.
- 11. Learning and daycare
  Today, kids spend way too much time sitting down in school. By unbundling learning and daycare, online learning will change that. Kids will benefit by escaping the tyranny of boring lectures. For parents who need supervision, let's expand daycare hours.

- Reading for Meaning (A Thread)
  You were taught how to read aloud as a child, but you were probably never taught to read for meaning.
- Reading for meaning means reading things with purpose. 
  It’s a useful reading hat to put on when you’re dealing with information dense writing, like textbooks, non-fiction books, blogs and academic papers.
- Reading for meaning means reading aggressively. 
  You have questions and you’re looking for answers.
- Your purpose for reading could be to increase your understanding of some theme, getting clarity about a topic you’re confused about or answering a burning question.
- Finding your purpose for reading something is as easy as asking:
  “Why am I reading this? What do I want to learn?”
  That question primes the mind to look for information which is relevant to your purpose.
- Here's my 7 step system for reading for meaning: https://t.co/sP0Es4szfe
- Notice how you don’t just read once over. Here we make 4 or 5 passes over the text in one reading.
- Remember that you don’t need to read a book from start to finish. 
  You don’t need to read every word or every page. 
  You don’t need to finish it all in one sitting and remember every single line.

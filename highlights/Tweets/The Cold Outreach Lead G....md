- The cold outreach lead gen script that's made me over 300k
  1. Open with a quality comment on a podcast, post, or side project they're involved in.
  Alternatively, comment on big company news that you can tie in with your angle.
- 2. You will establish your credibility and explain the tangible benefits of your service in one sentence.
- "Based on conversations I'm having with prospects in {their target industry} & past success with {companies in their industry}, I am confident I can bring you at least X qualified buyers within 30 days."
- Only do this if you have real success stories & references.
  If not, leave that part out & let them know you'll bring them X qualified buyers at no up front cost.
  3. "Do you have time for a quick discussion this week?"
- They'll get this messaging from multiple different angles.
  -LinkedIn Connection -InMessage (double visbility as it goes to their DMs & email inbox)
  -Email
  -Cold calls/voicemails on their business line & personal cell of available
- You will keep following up through each channel every few days with new messaging
  There's the classic
  "Believe me I know you're busy like the other {title} I work with to bring more revenue.
  Hopefully I'll be able to lighten your workload soon!
  Bumping this up for visibility"
- There's also the value added brag.
  Basically you go into detail about tangible results you've produced for another client & how you could replicate it for them due to XYZ (must actually do research on company)
- One of my favorites:
  Remember, emotion sells.
  Play on their fears & jealousy
  "I have an idea that you could implement to flip some {their big competitor} customers over to {their company}. I'd like to break it down for you when you have 3-5 minutes"
- Again requires a lot of research.
  No prospects will have the exact same script. 
  You need to demonstrate value through knowledge & research for them to want to even talk to you.
  This takes time & effort and there is absolutely no way around it.
- You are leaving money on the table if you just do 1 personalized line & don't adjust messaging according to different variables.
  Even more money being left on the table by doing generic {first_name} and {company messages

### Highlights

- “Self-doubt can be an ally. This is because it serves as an indicator of aspiration. It reflects love, love of something we dream of doing, and desire, desire to do it. If you find yourself asking yourself (and your friends), "Am I really a writer? Am I really an artist?" chances are you are.” - The War of Art
- what most people don’t realize is that the resistance to writing is not unlike the resistance to other skills. And the antidote? Practice. Exposure. Iteration.
- Practice makes any seemingly impossible task familiar.
- the more I write, the more I feel the flywheel effect in action.
- You know what makes you a writer? Writing.
- "Each time you write a page, you are a writer. Each time you practice the violin, you are a musician. Each time you start a workout, you are an athlete. Each time you encourage your employees, you are a leader." - Atomic Habits
- Writing, just like all else, is a muscle that can be flexed and built up into a habitual process that eventually flows. Because at its core, writing is simple: it’s a method of sharing your thoughts.
- What most people don’t realize is that it’s often not actually the writing that is difficult. It’s the thinking behind the writing.
- “Writing is thinking. To write well is to think clearly. That's why it's so hard." - David McCullough
- As Einstein once said, “If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.”
- "It’s through writing that we exercise our ability to think; they’re not mutually exclusive tasks." - Grammarly
- The thinking <> writing (TAW) cycle described above is powerful, but also lofty.
    - **Note:** The thinking <> writing cycle is what is powerful.
      Writing on a deadline helps you get around the cycle, but the trade-off is you only go around the cycle once. You want to go around continuously.
- So my solution is simple: I separate the two and exercise the cycle many times over.
- It’s extremely rare that I’ll come up with a concept and knock out the piece in one sitting.
    - **Note:** Develop ideas (i.e. thinking) and produce articles (i.e. writing) separately.
- To start, I would ask yourself the question, “What environment can I create that will make it most likely for me to show up to this task?”
- For me, that has come down to two things:
  Decoupling
  Optimizing for one variable
- Decoupling the Writing Process
- Writing Process Steps:
  Ideation - Passive
  Tracking - Active
  Outline - Active
  Idea Arbitrage - Passive
  Research - Active
  Writing - Active
- Optimizing for One Variable
- Optimizing for One Variable
- In my opinion, writing should never be something that you do just to check off of your to-do list. At its core, writing is a mechanism to try to deliver value to others. And over time, I’ve defined that as my core goal.
- This clearly isn’t always to my advantage, but it gives me something to orient around. If I tried to optimize completely across quality, speed, SEO-potential, among other variables, I would get paralyzed. So instead, I focus on one thing: quality.
- How I Write: 6 Steps
- Step 1) Ideation: Passive
- In order to get my TAW loop going, I set an open invitation to my brain to take note of anything interesting. More specifically, I look for anything within the intersection of: (1) interesting, (2) doesn’t exist online in that exact form, and (3) something I can contribute uniquely to.
- You know when you’re younger and someone disagrees with you, so they ask you to rattle off examples supporting your argument? Put on the spot, you feel stuck and unable to think of any, despite knowing there are many. The same would be true if I asked you to come up with 10 great article topics on the spot. Allowing yourself to catch onto signals passively is the most sure route to accumulating a lovely cabinet of concepts.
- Step 2) Tracking: Active
- The next step is tracking, which is basically just adding the idea to my ongoing spreadsheet. But more importantly, I’ll typically take the opportunity to quickly do some keyword research.
- I want to see if the article has the potential to rank. Even though SEO is a fancy word for a not-so-fancy industry, keyword research is essentially a mechanism to see if this is something people are actually looking for.
- I also do keyword research at this stage to spot secondary keywords that may influence the outline I create next.
- Step 3) Outline - Active
- At this point, I’ll utilize the mix of my (rough) ideas and SEO research to create an outline. It’s always in bullet-point form and will have approximately 3-6 major headings, with sub-points underneath.
- Step 4) Idea Arbitrage - Passive
- In this stage, I simply let the article sit. I let the creative juices in my passive brain marinate and be stimulated by just about anything.
  If I run into an interesting tweet or quote or tidbit from an article, I’ll make sure to add it to the right outline. I do this for literally weeks or even months, until I feel like I’ve crafted a unique point of view.
- Step 5) Research - Active
- I typically augment an article with at least a few hours of active research.
- this only happens once I’ve done quite a bit of passive ruminating, so that I have a clear POV of what I want to convey.
- “To write a great book, you must first become the book.” - Atomic Habits
- Step 6) Writing - Active
- I’ll typically only sit down to really craft a piece once I have at least a few thousand words of what I’ve started to call “notes ‘n quotes”.
- “When scientists analyze people who appear to have tremendous self-control, it turns out those individuals aren’t all that different from those who are struggling. Instead, “disciplined” people are better at structuring their lives in a way that does not require heroic willpower and self-control.” - Atomic Habits
- “There's a secret that real writers know that wannabe writers don't, and the secret is this: It's not the writing part that's hard. What's hard is sitting down to write.” - The War of Art
- When I am struggling to put words on paper, I’ll ask myself the following questions:
  How would I explain this to a friend? This helps me discern whether I’ve actually spent enough time thinking through the core concepts. Remember, writing is thinking.
  What specifically are you getting hung up on? I find that sometimes I can get caught up in certain problematic routines. For example, if I created an outline with a ton of info, sometimes I struggle to strip some of it out. If I reflect and catch myself doing this, I will more readily cut things out.
- This is the only phase where I will set time limits. Not because I have deadlines, but because I’m trying to improve my “finishing muscle”. To this day, I still have over a dozen articles that I almost finished, but did not. And there’s a clear course across all of them. I got maybe 80-90% there, but since I didn’t finish them completely, the Lindy effect only becomes more material.
- “Resistance is most powerful at the finish line” - The War of Art
- Just Do It
- I encourage you to focus on the process and not the outcome.
- The best way to improve your writing skills is to write (and to write a lot). If you’re focused on a process that helps you build new skills, most notably your ability to parse and process information tactfully, you cannot lose.
- With any skill that you hope to acquire, there is no magic moment. It’s a never-ending process of going from good to great.
- “The professional has learned that success, like happiness, comes as a by-product of work.” - The War of Art

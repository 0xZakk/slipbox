- The easiest way to be discovered right now in technology and perhaps many fields is to create your own independent blog and write. There is a huge dearth in availability of good, current, first party content today.
- Seeds of inspiration come to us from interesting places and swirl around us continually as we do our daily jobs (and for most of us, writing is not one of them).
- Many of the brightest minds of tomorrow are thinking about how to change the world.
- When these ideas come to you in a way where you can “see” a logical argument or flowing idea, think of it as how it would sound being written down. And write your immediate stream of conscious ideas and thoughts down as if no one is watching (secret: they aren’t).
- The single most important advice I can give to actually write is to write. Not to visualize in isolation. To put down words – ideally on a computer – thoughts and pieces of linked content that formulate your ideas.
- It’s okay if that post ends up being split or combined later. But you must write down partially formulated thoughts and forego editing and working on the cohesive transitional statements until after it’s developed.
- Transitions are so critical.
- At the bottom of that draft write a demarcation such as “===” and continually cut passages / sentences which aren’t needed and paste them to the bottom. You should always be subtracting and moving things out. Those ideas may have been seeds at the time, but later may appear silly or unnecessary. As I write this actual post, this is how it all came together.
- You don’t need (and won’t have) that satiated feeling when you just begin writing. The key is to write down what you are passionate about and trust it will arrive in to a form later.

## Highlights

### Highlights

- If you want success, figure out the price, then pay it.
- The point isn’t to abandon the pursuit of wealth, of course. Or even fancy cars – I like both. It’s recognizing that people generally aspire to be respected by others, and humility, graciousness, intelligence, and empathy tend to generate more respect than fast cars.
- “Current [investment] beliefs depend on the realizations experienced in the past.”
- Optimism is a belief that the odds of a good outcome are in your favor over time, even when there will be setbacks along the way.
- The punchline of compounding is never that it’s just big. It’s always – no matter how many times you study it – so big that you can barely wrap your head around it.
- You never get accustomed to how quickly things can grow.
- The danger here is that when compounding isn’t intuitive, we often ignore its potential and focus on solving problems through other means. Not because we’re overthinking, but because we rarely stop to consider compounding potential.
- Physicist Albert Bartlett put it: “The greatest shortcoming of the human race is our inability to understand the exponential function.”
- A key point here is that few things in money are as valuable as options. The ability to do what you want, when you want, with who you want, and why you want, has infinite ROI.
- Wealth, in fact, is what you don’t see.

Author: I Go Deep On Topics I Find Interesting

- Revenue volatility: Unstable pay.
  Workload volatility: Sporadic, high workload weeks.
  Work inefficiency: Senior staff doing too much repetitive or low-level work.
  Treadmill of tasks: Endlessly working on undifferentiated projects.
  Client interaction: A revolving door of occasionally difficult clients.
- each of these is mostly addressable except client interaction
- If you cannot identify a reduced yet valuable scope of ongoing services for your market, consider pivoting to something that allows for it. Otherwise, you will not progress toward passive income. You'll be hustling for new clients until you retire.
- Even if you're at capacity, continue generating leads.

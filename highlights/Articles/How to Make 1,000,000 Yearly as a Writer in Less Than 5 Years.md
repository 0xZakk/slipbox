- During my PhD program in organization psychology, I studied the difference between wannabe entrepreneurs and successful ones. One of the major differences is that wannabe entrepreneurs haven’t created a “point of no return” experience for themselves. They haven’t fully committed to their goal. They haven’t put sufficient skin in the game. They haven’t put themselves in a position where extreme consequences could happen. They still don’t see themselves as entrepreneurs — thus, they haven’t shifted their identity.
- Many of the wannabe entrepreneurs I interviewed said they hoped to one day have such a point of no return, but hadn’t created that experience for themselves yet. From my perspective, these “wannabe’s” don’t really have hope, because if they did, they would be actively creating the outcomes they want. True hope isn’t passive, it’s active and adaptive. It’s outcome-oriented and outcome-producing.

- Mattis, a revered Marine with a military career spanning four decades, credits his leadership success to his voracious reading habits.
- He was known for his strategy, matter-of-factness and disdain for PowerPoint, which is recognized as the U.S. military’s signature teaching tool.
- In October 2016, a Marine asked Mattis how he continues to develop as a leader. Mattis once again pointed to reading.
  “You stay teachable most by reading books, by reading what other people went through,” Mattis said. “I can’t tell you the number of times I looked down at what was going on on the ground or I was engaged in a fight somewhere and I knew within a couple of minutes how I was going to screw up the enemy. And I knew it because I’d done so much reading.”
  He added: “I knew what I was going to do because I’d seen other similar situations in the reading. I knew how they’d been dealt with successfully or unsuccessfully.”
- Like Mattis, Kelly is an advocate of professional development through reading.

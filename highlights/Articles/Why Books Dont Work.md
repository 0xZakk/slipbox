- And at least for non-fiction books, one implied assumption at the foundation: people absorb knowledge by reading sentences.
- All this suggests a peculiar conclusion: as a medium, books are surprisingly bad at conveying knowledge, and readers mostly don’t realize it.
- “The Persistence of Memory,”
- Books break the shackles of time
- A book is proof that humans are capable of working magic
- Books don’t work for the same reason that lectures don’t work: neither medium has any explicit theory of how people actually learn things, and as a result, both mediums accidentally (and mostly invisibly) evolved around a theory that’s plainly false.
  
- cognitive models
- “transmissionism.”
- to understand something, you must actively engage with it
- “metacognition.”
- By contrast, textbooks do have explicit cognitive models: they support engagement with their concepts through things like exercises and discussion questions. Yet much of the metacognitive burden still remains with the reader.
- Instead, I propose: we don’t necessarily have to make books work. We can make new forms instead
- It’s not just that it’s possible to create a medium informed by certain ideas in cognitive science. Rather, it’s possible to weave a medium made out of those ideas, in which a reader’s thoughts and actions are inexorably—perhaps even invisibly—shaped by those ideas.

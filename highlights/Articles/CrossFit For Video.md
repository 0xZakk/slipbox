- **Summary:** 
- **Notes:**
    - If you take photos or record a video on your iPhone, people wont be able to tell that you're not using a camera
    - Cam started sending videos to potential clients and it helped him land more deals
    - Hospital administrator - consultants gave him all this data about how he needed to improve the patient experience. The data didn't sway him, so the consultants recorded a video of a gurney looking up at the ceiling and going throughout the hospital. The video is what made it click for the hospital administrator.
    - Cam:
        - Founder, Actionworks
        - Professor at UT Austin
        - Records all these videos from a corner of his living room
    - **Agenda:**
        - Video Creation Crash Course
        - Ideation + Planning
        - Making Videos Part 1
        - Screening and Feedback
        - Making Videos Part 2
    - The Spotlight Effect 
        - We tend to notice small details about ourselves that other people don't
        - In Cam's welcome video, he noticed he had a crease in his shirt and some fly aways from his hair.
        - No one noticed these things!
        - Feedback is the way to get better. Make videos, get feedback, make more videos.
    - Examples of what to make today:
        - Welcome video to website or newsletter
        - FAQ Video - share knowledge by answering a question you get asked a lot
        - Video Article - some current or future writing told on Camera
        - Literally anything else - you have no downsides for experimenting today
    - Tips:
        - Keep the room quiet
        - Use the selfie camera and make eye contact with the camera
    - Ideas:
        - Welcome video for my newsletter
        - Video article on recent article (time blocking)
        - **Thank you video for a recent client (BPI)**
            - Hey Joe and Mike,
            - I just wanted to reach out to say that I'm really excited we've finished the Doppler MVP
            - I'm really looking forward to hearing the feedback y'all get from the team
            - I wanted to send this short message just to say thank you to you both
            - BPI was the first big clients for Hawthorne Interactive and I just so appreciate y'all hiring me to help you out
            - I've really enjoyed the two projects we've done together and I'm looking forward to hopefully many more
            - Which brings me to the next thing I wanted to tell y'all
            - Over the last few weeks, I've been working on something on the side that is going to make your work a lot easier and I'm really excited to give this to you
            - It's not quite finished yet, so I wont give you any more details right now
            - But be on the look out for another email from me with a gift on behalf of Hawthorne Interactive
            - Anyway, I hope y'all have a great week and I'll talk to you both soon
            - **Feedback**
                - Look at the camera hole
                - Move the camera up - put it on some books or something
                    - Looking up feels kind of strange
                - Background
                    - Angles in the background are weird
                - Said "thank you" twice - edit out the first one
    - Learn by Doing:
        - Framing and Composition:
            - Minimal headroom
            - Camera at eye level
            - Rule of thirds
        - Background:
            - Make it personal
            - Have it send a message in line with your brand
        - Script v Outline
        - Do test shots first
            - If you do a perfect shot and forgot to hit record or forgot to turn on the lights, you'll be so angry
            - So do a test video first
        - Editing:
            - Trim the front and the back

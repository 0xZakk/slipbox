- Everyone should write. You know why? Because everyone is full of ideas they’re not aware of.
- You don’t talk about these ideas, even in your own head, because you’ve never put them into words. 
- Like phantom intelligence.
- Writing crystallizes ideas in ways thinking on its own will never accomplish.
- Warren Buffett once said:
  Some of the things I think I think, I find don’t make any sense when I start trying to write them down. You ought to be able to explain why you’re taking the job you’re taking, why you’re making the investment you’re making, or whatever it may be. And if it can’t stand applying pencil to paper, you’d better think it through some more.
  
- A common question people ask professional writers is, “Where do you get your ideas?” A common answer is, “From writing.”

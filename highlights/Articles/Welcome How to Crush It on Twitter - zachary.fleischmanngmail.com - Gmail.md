- Even in college, when I had less than 1,000 followers on Twitter, I could reach the kinds of decision-makers online I would have never met in person like authors, CEOs, recruiters, investors, and entrepreneurs.
- When I was looking for my first job during my senior year, my tweets attracted the attention of Jason Stein. He was the CEO of Laundry Service, a New York-based advertising agency with clients like Jordan, Amazon, and Apple. Impressed by my ideas, he replied with eight words that changed my life: “Interested in working with us when you graduate?”
- Over the next five days, I’ll share five strategies for using Twitter effectively. I’ll talk about writing tweets, building an audience, curating your feed, writing direct messages, and making friends on Twitter.
- Why do I love Twitter so much?

  Yeah, I know. But of all those people, only a small number know how to use Twitter to spark connections, improve their thinking, and accelerate their career.

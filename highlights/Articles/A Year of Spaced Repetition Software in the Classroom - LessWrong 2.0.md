- SRS can raise student achievement even with students who won't use the software on their own, and even with frequent disruptions to the study schedule. Gains are most apparent with the already high-performing students, but are also meaningful for the lowest students. Deliberate efforts are needed to get student buy-in, and getting the most out of SRS may require changes in course design.
- The procedure
- First, what I did not do. I did not make Anki decks, assign them to my students to study independently, and then quiz them on the content. With honors classes I taught in previous years I think that might have worked, but I know my current students too well. Only about 10% of them would have done it, and the rest would have blamed me for their failing gradesâ€”with some justification, in my opinion.
  Instead, we did Anki together, as a class, nearly every day.
- With a third-party add-on for Anki called Zoom, I enlarged the display font sizes to be clearly legible on the interactive whiteboard at the front of my room.
- Nightly, I wrote up cards to reinforce new material and integrated them into the deck in time for the next day's classes.
- Daily, I led each class in an Anki review of new and due cards for an average of 8 minutes per study day, usually as our first activity, at a rate of about 3.5 cards per minute.
- As each card appeared on the interactive whiteboard, I would read it out loud while students willing to share the answer raised their hands.
- Whole-class SRS not ideal
- Every student is different, and would get the most out of having a personal Anki profile determine when they should see each card.
- Also, most individuals could study many more cards per minute on their own than we averaged doing it together.
- Getting student buy-in
- As for the daily class review, I induced engagement partly through participation points that were part of the final semester grade, and which students knew I tracked closely
- But because I know my students are not strongly motivated by grades, I think the most important influence was my attitude. I made it a point to really turn up the charm during review and play the part of the engaging game show host. Positive feedback. Coaxing out the lurkers. Keeping that energy up. Being ready to kill and joke about bad cards.
- I also got my students more on the Anki bandwagon by showing them how this was directly linked reduced note-taking requirements.

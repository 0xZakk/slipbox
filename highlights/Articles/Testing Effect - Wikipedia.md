### Highlights

- The testing effect is the finding that long-term memory is often increased when some of the learning period is devoted to retrieving the to-be-remembered information.
- The effect is also sometimes referred to as retrieval practice, practice testing, or test-enhanced learning.
- It is useful for people to test their knowledge of the to-be-remembered material during the learning process, instead of only reading or otherwise passively studying the material. For example, a student can use flashcards to self-test and receive feedback as they study. The testing effect provides a larger benefit to long-term memory when the tested material is difficult enough to require effort, the rate of retrieval success is high, and feedback with correct answers is given after testing.

- Retrieval practice is a founded twist on the testing effect and is used widely across many classrooms in order to help students recall information prior to an exam, excluding inhabitable influences.
- Benefits of testing are often only visible after a substantial delay and not immediately after practice, when outcomes may even be better for passively restudied materials than for tested materials.
- According to the retrieval effort hypothesis, "difficult but successful retrievals are better for memory than easier successful retrievals".
- For example, Pyc and Rawson showed that repeated testing is more beneficial for learning if the intervals between repeated testing are long and each test is therefore more difficult than when the intervals are short and tests are easy.
- This finding is related to the theory that certain conditions that make learning more effortful through so-called desirable difficulties are beneficial.
- Two views have arisen as to why testing seems to provide such a benefit over repeated study.
- The first view, provided by McDaniel, states that testing allows people to formulate newer, more lasting connections between items than does repeated study.
- The second view, provided by Karpicke and Roediger studied the effect of testing on memory retention.
- They found that re-studying or re-reading memorized information had no effect, but trying to recall the information had an effect.
- Spacing has also been shown to improve memory in younger and older adults. The spacing effect improves long-term memory from learning material with a break in between learning other information, while the testing effect improves long-term memory by restudying learned information through testing. Both of these methods have been combined to be referred to as space retrieval practice.

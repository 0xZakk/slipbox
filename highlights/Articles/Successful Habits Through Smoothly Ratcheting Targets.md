# Successful habits through smoothly ratcheting targets

-   Adopting new habits is hard! What a shame: New Year’s resolutions could represent such a bright spark of optimism. Instead, they’re a clichéd punchline on the futility of human will.
    
-   But in 2017, I shifted strategies and successfully built four new habits (of five attempted): piano practice, internetless mornings, carbless workdays, and meditation.
    
-   I’d like to share my approach: **smoothly ratcheted targets, in moving weekly windows, with teeth**.
    
-   Most people seem to attempt habits informally, deploying only hope and good intentions. Alas: that doesn’t work very reliably
    
-   **More serious approaches typically employ one of two formal strategies: chaining, or scheduling.**
    
-   Chaining is basically “cold turkey” habit adoption: start doing it every day—and don’t break your chain!
    
-   This approach combines an incentive system (maintaining streaks) with an adoption system (“start doing it every day!”).
    
-   Streaks can offer a powerful incentive for an established habit, but they do little for fragile new habits. It’s the adoption strategy that really matters initially, yet “start doing it every day!” is a brittle—and, to me, unrealistic—adoption strategy.
    
-   Seeing that daily compliance is too ambitious, **others try scheduling their habits**: let’s play piano on Monday and Thursday nights!
    
-   this works intermittently, but it’s ultimately too brittle in the face of a life I’d want to live.
    
-   Say Thursday rolls around, and over lunch, a friend invites me to an interesting evening event. No problem: the spirit of my goal would be satisfied if I practiced over the weekend instead. But because I’m depending on explicit scheduling to trigger practice, now I have to actually move a calendar event. That’s high-friction, so instead I just accidentally drop the ball until next Monday.
    
-   I’ve found that to reliably adopt a habit, I need a strategy that bends, not breaks, while still holding me accountable over time.
    
-   So now I start each habit with a low weekly goal: e.g. meditate once per week, any day. That bar is low enough that I don’t have to schedule it or do anything special. Once that stabilizes, I ratchet up the target frequency.
    
## Smooth pressure demands moving windows: make every day doable
    
-   Being human, I’d often put off my habits to the end of the week. That worked reasonably well until some goals targeted three days per week. Then it was way too easy to end up in this trap:

-   To avoid trapping myself, I’d have to perform a sort of time traveling lookahead each day.

-   **I’ve found that smooth pressure demands we ensure that every day is doable. There should never be an “impossible” day like the one I illustrated above!**

-   **We can make that happen if we use moving weekly windows instead of calendar weeks.** Every day, look back a week and make sure you hit your goal within that 7-day window.

-   With a moving weekly window, I can tackle habits on whichever days seem best, but I always get a clear warning when today is a “jeopardy” day. I don’t have to look into the future to figure out whether I’ll be able to hit my goal.
        
## Smooth ratcheting and flexibility through fine-grained targets
    
-   When it’s time to ratchet up the target, adding one day per week to a habit can feel like a huge change! I find that fine-grained values work better when possible.

-   For my piano practice, I don’t use “numbers of days practiced per week”: I use “number of minutes practiced per week.” I barely notice adding ten minutes per week to the goal, so I can smoothly ratchet up my target.

-   These fine-grained values also offer more flexibility. Say I want two hours a week of practice. That could be two big weekend practice sessions, or 15–20 minutes per day, or a 1-hour session with a couple smaller sessions. All those configurations hit my target, but the flexibility helps me maintain specific goals in the face of my shifting daily interest and availability.

## Give the goals teeth

-   Accountability is powerful! Certainly, in the workplace, I find I achieve my goals more reliably when I have some real skin in the game. The same appears to be true for personal habits.

-   It’s probably only important that there be some consequence to slipping, or maybe some incentive for not slipping.

-   I’ve arranged to lose a small amount of money ($10–$30) when I miss a goal.

## Implementing the habit goals

-   I’m not a “quantified self” adherent, and I’m not interested in graphs or an elaborate dashboard for my habits. But the mechanism I’ve described is complicated enough that a tool really helps implementation.

-   The best tool I’ve found for implementing this strategy is [Beeminder](https://href.li/?https://www.beeminder.com), which happily handles all the nuances I’ve described above.

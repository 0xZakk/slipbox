# Alchemix

Taking out a loan and not repaying it. Normal banks raise your interest a lot.

Alchemix is a crypto platform that lets you take out a loan that will repay itself over time. You never have to pay it back

Covers:
- what Alchemix is
- How to use it
- The future

## Alchemix

Vaults
- Provide collateral in DAI or ETH, take out a loan against that collateral, have the debt paid down by the yield on that collateral
- Deposit DAI, goes into vault on yearn.finance where it generates yield, that yield pays down your debt

Two Vaults:
1. DAI
- Collateralization ratio: how much you can deposit v how much you can borrow against it - 200%
- If you deposit $100, you can take out $50
- Amount you can borrow
- Global Mintable alUSD: coin that you borrow back (can be exchanged for DAI)

2. ETH
- Higher collateralization ratio (400%). If you put in $100, you can take out $25

## Risks

Already audited by CerTech and Runtime

Smart contract risk - happens on any platform. Basically, bugs in the contract.
- MakerDAO protocol failure
- DAI goes off peg (has happened with other stable coins)
- Alchemix protocol failure (smart contract risk)
- alUSD off peg
- Curve protocol failure
- Lowering of yield rates on Curve

## Transmuter

Takes alUSD and gradually converts it into DAI to ensure alUSD stays pegged to the USD

## Farms

Liquidity pools you can earn a pair

### Highlights

- A few months ago, a tweet popped up on my timeline, where Juvoni Beckford shared an incredible achievement: reading 450 books over the course of a decade. As someone who loves reading and thinks that everyone would benefit from reading more books—whether fiction or nonfiction—I was understandably impressed by Juvoni’s consistency.
- He has read books about anything from psychology, philosophy, personal development, business, science, economics, history, sociology, communication, technology, politics, as well as many biographies and fiction books.
- In this interview, we talked about collecting life skills through books, selecting the best books to read, navigating your inner world, using the real world as a spaced repetition system, creating a meaningful highlighting system, the dangers of working in public, making space for serendipity, and much more.
- I reached out when I saw you have read more than 450 books, which is impressive. When did you start reading so much? Was there a specific goal?
- I actually used to despise reading. I hated reading for much of my childhood. Every time I would get in trouble, it would always be: “Go turn off the TV and go read books.”
- So I spent much of my life avoiding books.
- I think two things helped change my mindset towards reading.
- The first was cartoons, and specifically X-Men and other shows where people are able to collect multiple abilities. With my friends, we would always get into these conversations about who’s the most super powered mutant. And they would choose professor Xavier, or Wolverine, or someone else. But there was one mutant in particular, called Rogue, who was so powerful that the show actually had to take away some of her powers. Because if she touched you, she could temporarily take away your abilities and memories. Her abilities were essentially limitless.
- That’s when something clicked in my mind: I found myself reading a book and being able to do things that I wasn’t able to do before. And I asked myself: what happens if I read two books, or three books? I can start collecting these different perspectives about how the world works, these different abilities. That was a huge mental shift for me.
- The other thing was that I grew up in the Bronx, where I didn’t have much resources. My mom was my biggest inspiration and influence, and I learned a lot about my values through her. But books were a way for me to learn from the past, to have mentors who had lived hundreds of years ago. And for a kid who didn’t have a father figure, nor much role models, books were a way to get some guidance.
- Talking about mentors, is that how you go about picking books? Do you choose a mentor you want to learn from, or do you decide based on a particular topic of interest?
- I read very broadly. If you look on my book list, there is no limitation towards what themes I’ll read about. I could read about cheerleading if it’s relevant to what I’m trying to do. There are no boundaries.
- I try to avoid bestsellers, books that people widely recommend, or books with a big marketing promotion. I’ll usually try to delay and wait a little bit.
- I prefer to read books that are older, that are more time-tested.
- My inner child is probably still going well, because I treat reading books like collecting spells. If there is a certain obstacle that I face and I don’t yet have the right spell to cast, to either break a curse or to build a bridge, I will try to find a book that can help me.
- Part of it is me trying to navigate the external world, and the other side of it is me trying to navigate my internal world. That’s how I view fiction and non-fiction. Non-fiction is really good to help you navigate the mental models of the physical world, so you can understand how the world works, how to gain tactics and strategies to shape things in the real world.
  But you also have your inner world, which is your actual reality, as consciousness is an illusion that we all buy into on an individual level and on a collective level. Fiction can unlock these internal mental models within you. And it can unlock all sorts of visions for what’s possible in the world. Similar to the hero’s journey, it’s about finding your way to some promised land and making your way back home.
- Just to dig a bit deeper into the metaphor of collecting spells… It made me think about video games, where there are only that many potions or weapons you can carry in your bag. If you find a new item, you have to make room for it. It’s a bit similar with our memory, right? You can’t hold everything into your mind at the same time.

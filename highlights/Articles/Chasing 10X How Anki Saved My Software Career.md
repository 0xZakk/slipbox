- I wanted to be a good, hell, great software engineer. But my work was mediocre. Even worse, I was trying. My ass was in that chair twelve hours a day, six days a week trying to write beautiful Python code. I was constantly looking up documentation and sucked into the internet's rabbit-hole of distractions. I was a try-hard failure.
- Kyle worked weekdays from 10AM to 4PM. He got his work done early and single-handedly output 80% of the entire team. Adding more insult to injury, he only worked like 60% of the time.
- Every day for three years, I spent one to three hours in spaced repetition. It was brutal and I needed it.
- Spaced repetition is a remembering technique that will remind you concepts at spaced intervals to maximize memory retention efficiently. It's a strategy to remind our brains of facts; it exploits that the best time to be remember a fact is right before we forget it. Our brains are forgetful, but we can use strategies to make it less forgetful.
- Anki and SuperMemo are the most common spaced repetition applications. Both help create flashcards and quiz based off an spacing algorithm. If you get a question right, it'll ask again further out. Get a card wrong? It'll remind you tomorrow.
- And for the last three years, I've added EVERYTHING to Anki. Bash aliases, IDE Shortcuts, programming APIs, documentation, design patterns, etc. Having done that, I wouldn't recommend adding EVERYTHING.
- Benefits
- Spaced repetition requires a daily commitment, but guarantees a great memory.
- Most users average about twenty minutes a day reviewing. If you're adding zero additional cards (cough, slacker), your review time averages to zero as knowledge become long-term memory. The confidence of knowing that once something is added to Anki it won't be forgotten is intoxicating.
- Spaced repetition is my most important career/life-hack. It's not always easy. It doesn't guarantee you'll be a better engineer (best practices and design beats syntax), but it'll make you a capable one. When you can quickly recall syntax, you'll be amazed at how fast you can code. Sometimes that just results in shitty code, faster. But the best coders code a lot. And that's the only guaranteed way to improve.
- Knowledge compounds in interesting ways. Many of my flashcards include blogs and articles about engineering â€” knowing the history of RPC, SOAP, REST and GraphQL has lead to improved design and architecture decisions. Counter: Memorizing binary search tree algorithms has yet to come in handy

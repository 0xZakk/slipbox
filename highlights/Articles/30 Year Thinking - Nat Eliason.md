### Highlights

- What do you want to be doing in 30 years?
- Developing a sense of what energizes or drains you is essential for long term productivity. If you force yourself into doing draining work all day, you're unlikely to accomplish anything meaningful for yourself or the field. But even an hour a day of energizing work can create huge long term benefits.
- Great progress comes from compound interest. This is certainly true for building wealth, but also for skill development and completing great work.
- By finding energizing work you create a flywheel effect: the work is self-sustaining and compounds upon itself.
- But you only get compounding interest from your work by sticking with it. If you jump from project to project, or skill to skill, you might get that "20% that gets you 80% of the results," but there's a second order effect to pareto optimality. If you can quickly learn 80% of a skill, so can anyone else. It's not impressive that you learned the first 80%, and if you jump between a bunch of skills getting to 80% in them, you haven't gone anywhere. You've chosen optionality over investing in something.
  Which brings us back to the question: what do you want to be doing in 30 years? And is that reflected in how you spend your time?
- Your lifestyle also demands examination. What rituals do you want to be doing in 30 years? And how much of that life can you create now? Exercise is a particularly important one. You can still get in shape if you start exercising later, but it's easier to run a marathon at 70 if you also ran one at 60.
- The challenge with 30 year thinking is it requires making difficult choices in the short term so you can move towards the life you want in the long term. Time for writing has to come from somewhere. You might get FOMO from skipping happy hour. Friends whose 30 year trajectories don't excite you may need to go. The changes arenâ€™t easy, but a little pain now is better than a life of regret.
- 30 year thinking can provide clarity you didn't realize you had about how you should spend your time:
  Is this work something I want to improve at for the next 30 years?
  Is this person someone I want to see weekly for the next 30 years?
  Is this habit or ritual something I want to do for the next 30 years?
  Is this how I want to spend my money for the next 30 years?
  Is this a topic I want to read about for the next 30 years?
  Is this how I want my body to look, or feel, for the next 30 years?
- It's easy to fall in the "one day" trap. Believing that once you make more money, have more time, finish this project, you'll suddenly be free of the obligations standing between you and your ideal self.
  But "one day" never comes. We have to start creating that day now.

- **Summary:** 
- **Highlights:**
    - Musk said that his company [Neuralink](https://www.neuralink.com/) had built a self-contained neural implant that can wirelessly transmit detailed brain activity without the aid of external hardware.
    - Musk’s goal is to build a [neural implant](https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-human-os/biomedical/devices/what-is-neural-implant-neuromodulation-brain-implants-electroceuticals-neuralink-definition-examples) that can sync up the human brain with AI, enabling humans to control computers, prosthetic limbs, and other machines using only thoughts.
    - Musk’s aspirations for this brain-computer interface (BCI) system are to be able to read and write from millions of neurons in the brain, translating human thought into computer commands, and vice versa.
    - And it would all happen on a small, wireless, battery-powered implant unseen from the outside of the body.
    - Teams of researchers globally have been experimenting with surgically implanted BCI systems in humans for over 15 years. The [BrainGate](https://www.braingate.org/) consortium and other groups have used BCI to enable people with neurologic diseases and paralysis to [operate tablets](https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-human-os/biomedical/devices/paralyzed-individuals-operate-tablet-with-brain-implant), [type eight words per minute](https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-human-os/biomedical/bionics/new-record-for-typing-by-brain-paralyzed-man-uses-brain-implant-to-type-8-words-per-minute) and control [prosthetic limbs](https://spectrum.ieee.org/biomedical/bionics/a-better-way-for-brains-to-control-robotic-arms) using only their thoughts.
    - All of this work is highly experimental. Since 2003, fewer than 20 people in the U.S. have received a BCI implant, all for restorative, medical purposes on a research basis. Most of these systems involve hardware protruding from the head, providing power and data transmission.
    - These external components create the potential risk of infection and aren’t practical outside a research setting.
    - Neuralink’s implant contains all the necessary components, including a battery, processing chip, and bluetooth radio, along with about a thousand electrode contacts, all on board the device. Each electrode records the activity of somewhere between zero and four neurons in the brain. A thousand of them in a living animal would be the highest number the BCI field has seen from a self-contained implant.
    - But the company’s data has not yet been vetted by the research community. (Three pigs on a stage isn’t quite the same as peer-reviewed data).
    - How the device can transmit that much data without generating tissue-damaging heat is not yet demonstrated in humans.
    - Plus, Neuralink’s device is “pretty big” for the brain, says Ajiboye. Its cylindrical shape measures 23 mm in diameter by 8 mm long—about the size of a stack of 5 U.S. quarters.
    - By comparison, the [Utah array](http://www.blackrockmicro.com/electrode-types/utah-array/), which has been the go-to device for the BrainGate consortium, measures 4 mm x 4 mm. That device involves hardware protruding from the skull and contains about a hundred electrodes, compared to Neuralink’s 1000.
    - Neuralink achieved the advance by experimenting with different materials, upgrading the antennae and wirelessly transmitting only heavily compressed embeddings of neural data from the implant, along with other optimizations made possible through a fast feedback cycle, says Max Hodak, president of Neuralink, who spoke with Spectrum prior to today’s live demonstration.
    - Once this kind of brain wave data is obtained, the big question is how to decode and interpret it. “Neural decoding is critically important,” says Ajiboye. “A number of laboratories around the world are spending lots of person-hours on decoding algorithms, using different statistical and deep learning approaches. I haven’t seen that from Neuralink.”
    - Neuralink’s first applications for the technology will be for medical purposes, likely for people with spinal cord injuries. Musk, in bold fashion, has said he wants to pursue non-medical applications too

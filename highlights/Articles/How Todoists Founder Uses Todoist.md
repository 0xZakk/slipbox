## Highlights

### Highlights

- Systemist
- Systemist has 6 simple components
- 1. Take it everywhere
  A productivity system is only useful if you can access it everywhere you are.
- 2. Capture everything
  A productivity system is only useful if it captures all of the important things going on in both your personal and professional life. 
- 3. Break it up in small tasks and make them actionable
  Small tasks are easier to complete than big ones, so break big tasks into a number of smaller sub-tasks that can be completed in one hour or less.
- It’s also very important to make things actionable. You should be able to complete everything you have in your to-do list. Don’t keep items that you can’t complete.
- 4. Prioritize
- I use a @high_impact label on tasks that will create a high impact. 
- use due dates to specify when I want to complete something
- use Todoist’s priority levels to prioritize daily tasks.
- 5. Get to to-do list zero daily
- 6. Get consistent feedback

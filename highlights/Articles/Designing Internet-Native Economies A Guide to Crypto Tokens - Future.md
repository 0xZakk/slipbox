- One of the big, frequently discussed ideas of crypto is that it enables creators and communities to build their own internet-native economies. A key component of these economies is tokens
- They are (as has been argued by others too) a breakthrough in open network design, because they are a mechanism for incentivizing open network participants, including users, developers, investors, and service providers.
- There are two main categories of tokens: fungible (e.g., interchangeable) and non-fungible (e.g., unique). As more creators and communities build their own crypto economies, fungible tokens will be used to exchange goods, store value, and make collective decisions. Meanwhile, non-fungible tokens (e.g., NFTs) will be used to create new business models centered on collectibles, rewards, achievements, and more — giving people a sense of identity, status, and belonging.
- All the best crypto protocols, social apps, online communities, and marketplaces will need to deeply understand the interplay between fungible and non-fungible tokens to create their own internet economies.
- But why do we need internet-native economies in the first place?
- ## The limits of traditional economies
- Most traditional economies weren’t designed with the internet in mind. As a result, modern economies have a number of issues
- Lack of access. Globally, about 1.7 billion adults are unbanked. This limits the ability for people to start businesses, fund projects, and take entrepreneurial risks.
- Inefficiency. High fees on credit card transactions and remittances as well as high interest loans make it difficult for low-income communities to participate in the economy.
- Opacity. Banks operate under complex structures that make it difficult to understand their financial health and the risks they’re underwriting.
- These limitations reduce economic growth and amplify inequality.
- As more economic activity moves online, we need internet-native tools for building productive economies.
- This is where cryptonetworks come in. They provide the cryptographic (e.g., security without a third party) and economic building blocks for modern forms of production, distribution, trade, and consumption.
- ## Fungible tokens
- Traditionally, money has served three primary purposes:
  A medium of exchange to facilitate trade
  A store of value to preserve wealth over time
  A unit of account to provide a standard measure of value
- Economies invest money into productive assets like factories, scientific research, technology development, public infrastructure, etc. to drive economic growth. To make life enjoyable, consumers also purchase relatively “unproductive” goods like flat-screen TVs and high-end purses or sneakers.
  Cryptoeconomies follow a similar dynamic.
- In the Ethereum network, money is represented by the ERC20 standard for fungible (i.e., interchangeable) tokens. Meanwhile, goods are represented by the ERC721 standard for non-fungible (i.e., unique) tokens — these are more commonly referred to as NFTs. (There’s also the ERC1155 semi-fungible standard but for simplicity let’s focus on ERC20s and NFTs.)
- In addition to serving as a form of internet-native money, the programmable nature of ERC20 tokens enables three other use cases: equity, utility, and governance. Many tokens are a combination of each.
- ## Equity tokens
- Equity tokens are fungible tokens that represent ownership in an asset or a pool of assets. These tokens are used to incentivize participants to provide a scarce resource to a network. In cryptonetworks, scarce resources include capital, developers, customers, creators, and computing power.
- When designing an equity token system, it’s helpful to think through the following questions:
  What is the scarce resource our protocol needs?
  Who has this scarce resource?
  How do we incentivize them in a positive-sum way?
- ## Utility tokens
- Utility tokens are fungible tokens that unlock functionality in a smart contract or off-chain system (like a Discord community). Utility tokens are difficult to enforce off-chain, so they tend to be most valuable when their functionality is enforced purely on-chain, through smart contracts.
- When designing a utility token system, it’s helpful to think through the following questions:
  What is the core problem we’re trying to solve?
  Who are we solving it for?
  How do we help them solve it in a positive-sum way?
- Automated and trust-minimized loans
- To enable decentralized lending on blockchains like Ethereum, protocols require traders to deposit tokens into a smart contract as collateral to unlock the ability to take out a loan. Tokens used as collateral for decentralized loans are an example of a utility token because they unlock automated functionality in a smart contract.
- Compound is an example of a lending protocol building this on Ethereum. To take out a loan, you need to deposit one of the approved collateral tokens voted in through governance.
- Traders use Compound to take out leveraged long positions on ETH. For example, they’ll deposit ETH as collateral, borrow a stablecoin like USDC or DAI, and buy more ETH.
- Access to a community
- A common problem in online community building is fostering a sustainable community, one that limits spam, ensures members have skin in the game (vs. drive-by commenters), and incentivizes community members to make the overall community desirable to join over the long-term.
- ## Governance tokens
- Governance tokens represent percentage ownership over voting rights
- When designing a governance token system, it’s helpful to think through the following questions:
  What are the public goods that should be governed by our community?
  How should governance tokens be issued?
  How do we design the governance system to be fair, flexible, and transparent?
- ## Non-fungible tokens (NFTs)
- At a high level, NFTs are unique digital tokens stored on a blockchain
- people value virtual goods for six main reasons:
  Identity and belonging
  Status
  Personal meaning
  Relationships
  Collecting
  Superpowers
- ## Identity and belonging
- Identity and belonging are fostered by a sense of shared history and storytelling.
- ## Status
- Status is driven by price and scarcity.
- On social media, status usually comes from follower counts and engagement metrics such as likes, shares, retweets, etc. These metrics are really just virtual currencies that live in a company’s database. But they’re inefficient because it’s difficult to convert likes and followers into cash.
- But what if you could directly redeem likes for money?
- Instead, crypto-native social apps can allow consumers to vote on their favorite content, reward top-voted creators with NFTs, and allow these NFTs to be redeemed for a percentage of a prize pool. The process would be community-driven and independently verifiable because it’s done on-chain through crypto tokens and smart contracts.
- ## Personal meaning
- Personal meaning is driven by sentimental value and customization.

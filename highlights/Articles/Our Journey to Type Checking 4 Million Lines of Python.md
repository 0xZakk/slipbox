## Highlights

### Highlights

- The key to static type checking is scale: the larger your project, the more you want (and eventually need) it.
- Once your project is tens of thousands of lines of code, and several engineers work on it, our experience tells us that understanding code becomes the key to maintaining developer productivity.
- In a perfect world, you could expect these to be documented in a docstring, but experience overwhelmingly says that this is often not the case.
- it provides verified documentation.

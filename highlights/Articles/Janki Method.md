### Highlights

- Janki Method is an attempt to shorten the time needed to learn programming.
- You’ve read that learning by doing is better than passive reading; that expressing ideas in writing forces understanding; that knowledge needs constant revision to stay fresh; that creativity comes from linking disparate ideas; and that your past mistakes are your best teachers. How many of these ideas do you apply to your learning efforts?
- By following my approach, I believe that any intelligent and disciplined reader can achieve proficiency* in a given field of programming (e.g. web applications, iPhone applications) in less than 12 months.
- Problems With Learning
- Problem 1: We Forget Too Quickly
- Forgetting impedes learning knowledge-intensive skills such as programming. You need to remember various languages, solutions, libraries and gotchas if you want to build large applications. Because technical material can be so abstract and dry, you forget particularly quickly.
- The first rule of Janki boosts your memory:
  “Every time you learn something new create a question and answer flashcard and add this card to Anki.”
- Most algorithms make computers efficient; Anki makes you efficient.
- Using the minimal number of repetitions necessary for permanent retention, Anki drills flashcards into your long-term memory.
- Every morning Anki calculates which cards you risk forgetting, and then prompts you to review these cards. Doing your Ankis only takes a few minutes per day, since you only need to review a fraction of your deck on any given day.
- Problem 2: We Give Up Too Soon
- Most people fail to learn programming for the same reason they don’t get good at playing guitar: they give up too soon. Although they practice hard for the first few weeks, they soon lose motivation, and give up before they get results.
- The second rule of Janki encourages a commitment to daily learning:
  “You must use Anki every single day - including weekends and holidays - and commit to doing so indefinitely.”
- Doing your Ankis must hold the same force of habit as brushing your teeth, and you should feel naughty if you ever miss your Ankis.
- Rule 2 isn’t as demanding as it might at first seem. After a few months of practice you will be able do your Ankis in 5-8 minutes. Finding that time shouldn’t be a problem either, since Anki is available on smart-phone, meaning you can review while you walk to work, sit in the bus or have a spare minute at the office. Anki even synchronizes the state of your decks across all your devices, so changes to your desktop deck will be reflected across all of your devices.
- Problem 3: We Learn Out Of Context
- Learning out of context is wasteful. Reading a textbook from cover to cover may be interesting, but if those concepts are not relevant to the technical problems you currently face, then you will lack the mental context needed to assimilate that knowledge effectively.
- The third rule of Janki keeps you focused on what is important in the moment:
  “Learn in context. Pick a project, and learn only what you need to get it done.”
- Problem 4: We Think We Can Learn Without Doing
- Like sex, programming is better and more enjoyably mastered through practice. Learning without practice insulates you from reality.
- When you read about programming without trying out the code, you form an internal representation that is incomplete, poorly understood, and difficult to apply practically.
  You will fail to notice critical details. Many things may seem trivial when you first read about them in a textbook. Maybe it’s the placing of quotations around a parameter to a function, or rules about where whitespace is allowed. These overlooked points can often be critical in practice, and anything less than complete understanding will cripple your productivity.
- The fourth rule of Janki grounds knowledge in reality:
  “Only add a card to your deck after having tried to use the item of knowledge therein.”
- Problem 5: We Make More Mistakes Than We Need To
- Our past mistakes serve as excellent memory aids. This is a major reason why we learn by doing. That said, not all past mistakes are equally effective at teaching us lessons; there is a correlation between the emotional impact of an error and the length of time that lesson will remain in memory.

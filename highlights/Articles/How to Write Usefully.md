- What should an essay be? Many people would say persuasive. That's what a lot of us were taught essays should be. But I think we can aim for something more ambitious: that an essay should be useful.
- To start with, that means it should be correct.
- But it's not enough merely to be correct. It's easy to make a statement correct by making it vague. That's a common flaw in academic writing, for example. If you know nothing at all about an issue, you can't go wrong by saying that the issue is a complex one, that there are many factors to be considered, that it's a mistake to take too simplistic a view of it, and so on.
- Useful writing makes claims that are as strong as they can be made without becoming false.
- Precision and correctness are like opposing forces. It's easy to satisfy one if you ignore the other.
- Useful writing is bold, but true.
- The converse of vaporous academic writing is the bold, but false, rhetoric of demagogues.
- It's also two other things: it tells people something important, and that at least some of them didn't already know.
- Sometimes it means telling them something they knew unconsciously but had never put into words. In fact those may be the more valuable insights, because they tend to be more fundamental.
- Let's put them all together. Useful writing tells people something true and important that they didn't already know, and tells them as unequivocally as possible.
- Any insight that you have will probably have already been had by at least one of the world's 7 billion people. But it's sufficient if an idea is novel to a lot of readers.
- In effect the four components are like numbers you can multiply together to get a score for usefulness.
- Translated into essay writing, what this means is that if you write a bad sentence, you don't publish it. You delete it and try again.
- You can't ensure that every idea you have is good, but you can ensure that every one you publish is, by simply not publishing the ones that aren't.
- My strategy is loose, then tight. I write the first draft of an essay fast, trying out all kinds of ideas. Then I spend days rewriting it very carefully.

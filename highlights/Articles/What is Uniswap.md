What Is Uniswap?
-   Protocol, Interface, Labs   
    -   To begin, we should make clear the distinctions between the different areas of "Uniswap", some of which may confuse new users.
        -   Uniswap Labs: The company which developed the Uniswap protocol, along with the web interface.
        -   The Uniswap Protocol: A suite of persistent, non-upgradable smart contracts that together create an automated market maker, a protocol that facilitates peer-to-peer market making and swapping of ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.
        -   The Uniswap Interface: A web interface that allows for easy interaction with the Uniswap protocol. The interface is only one of many ways one may interact with the Uniswap protocol.
        -   Uniswap Governance: A governance system for governing the Uniswap Protocol, enabled by the UNI token.
    -   The following is a brief overview of the Uniswap protocol
-   Introduction
    -   The Uniswap protocol is a peer-to-contract\[1\] system designed for exchanging cryptocurrencies [(ERC-20 Tokens)](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) blockchain. The protocol is implemented as a set of persistent, non-upgradable smart contracts; designed to prioritize censorship resistance, security, self-custody, and to function without any trusted intermediaries who may selectively restrict access.
-   How does the Uniswap protocol compare to a typical market?
    -   To understand how the Uniswap protocol differs from traditional exchange, it is helpful to first look at two subjects: how Automated Market Maker design deviates from traditional central limit order book-based exchanges, and how permissionless systems depart from conventional permissioned systems.
    -   Order Book VS AMM
        -   Most publicly accessible markets use a central limit [order book](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/order-book.asp) style of exchange, where buyers and sellers create orders organized by price level that are progressively filled as demand shifts.
        -   The Uniswap protocol takes a different approach, using an Automated Market Maker (AMM), sometimes referred to as a Constant Function Market Maker, in place of an order book.
        -   At a very high level, an AMM replaces the buy and sell orders in an order book market with a liquidity pool of two assets, both valued relative to each other. As one asset is traded for the other, the relative price of the two assets shift, and a new market rate for both is determined.
        -   In this dynamic, a buyer or seller trades directly with the pool, rather than with specific orders left by other parties.
    -   Permissionless Systems
        -   The second departure from traditional markets is the permissionless design of the Uniswap protocol. Permissionless design means that the protocolâ€™s services are entirely open for public use, with no ability to selectively restrict who can or cannot use them: anyone can swap, provide liquidity, or create new markets at will.

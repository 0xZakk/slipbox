- The Age of Leverage
- The Internet and technology have given individuals more reach than the biggest media companies. That’s why 50-person startups can now serve 900 million people. Leverage is a force multiplier on everything you do and every decision you make, and once you gain it, you can achieve things that once looked impossible.
- When you create content, people can access your knowledge without taking your time. You no longer need to sell knowledge by the hour. Your ideas are the most valuable currency in a knowledge-driven economy. Just as an investment account allows your money to grow day and night without your involvement, content does the same with your ideas.
- Invest in your future. Whether you want to become an author or an entrepreneur, you should start writing online. No matter what kind of book you want to write or what kind of company you want to start, it pays to have a smart and targeted audience. If you plan to write a book, writing online will help you develop a voice and land a publishing deal. And if you plan to start a company, writing will help you build credibility, meet investors, and find future co-founders.
- Blogging isn’t dead. In fact, the opposite is true. We’re about to enter a golden age of personal blogs.

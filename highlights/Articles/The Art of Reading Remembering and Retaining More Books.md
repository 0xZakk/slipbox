## Highlights

### Highlights

- How much do you read?
- There’s reading fast, and then there’s reading lots. A combination of the two is going to be the best way to supercharge your reading routine, but each is valuable on its own.
- In this sense, a desire to read more might simply mean having more time to read, and reading more content — books, magazines, articles, blog posts — in whole.
- How to Talk About Books You Haven’t Read, written by University of Paris literature professor Pierre Bayard, suggests that we view the act of reading on a spectrum and that we consider more categories for books besides simply “have or haven’t read.” Specifically, Bayard suggests the following:
  books we’ve read
  books we’ve skimmed
  books we’ve heard about
  books we’ve forgotten
  books we’ve never opened.
- A great place to start with book retention is with understanding some key ways our brain stores information. Here are three specific elements to consider:
  Impression
  Association
  Repetition
- Impression — Be impressed with the text. Stop and picture a scene in your mind, even adding elements like greatness, shock, or a cameo from yourself to make the impression stronger.
- Association — Link the text to something you already know. This technique is used to great effect with memorization and the construction of memory palaces.
- Repetition — The more you repeat, the more you remember. This can occur by literally re-reading a certain passage or in highlighting it or writing it down then returning to it again later.
- I’ve tried this method for myself, and it has completely changed the way I perceive the books I read. I look at books as investments in a future of learning rather than a fleeting moment of insight, soon to be forgotten. I store all the reviews and notes from my books on my personal blog so I can search through them when I need to remember something I’ve read.
- One of the most common threads in my research into remembering more of the books you read is this: Take good notes.

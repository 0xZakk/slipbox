- I asked myself, “Is culture dogs at work and yoga in the break room?” No, those are perks. Is it your corporate values? No, those are aspirations. Is it the personality and priorities of the CEO? That helps shape the culture, but I’d just learned that it is far from the thing itself. So what is it?
- Let’s start with a simple exercise: How many of the following questions can be resolved by turning to your corporate goals or mission statement?
  Is that phone call so important I need to return it today or can it wait till tomorrow?
  Can I ask for a raise before my annual review?
  Is the quality of this document good enough or should I keep working on it?
  Do I have to be on time for that meeting?
  Should I stay at the Four Seasons or the Red Roof Inn?
  When I negotiate this contract, what’s more important: the price or the partnership?
  Should I point out what my peers do wrong or what they do right?
  Should I go home at 5 p.m. or 8 p.m.?
  How hard do I need to study the competition?
  Should we discuss the color of this new product for five minutes or 30 hours?
  If I know something is badly broken in the company, should I say something? Who should I tell?
  Is winning more important than ethics?
  The answer is zero.
- The right answers for your company depends on what your company is, what it does, and what it wants to be. In fact, how your employees answer these kinds of questions is your culture. Because your culture is how your company makes decisions when you’re not there. It’s the set of assumptions your employees use to resolve the problems they face every day. It’s how they behave when no one is looking. If you don’t methodically set your culture, then two-thirds of it will end up being accidental and the rest will be a mistake.
- Your culture is who you are. Who you are is not the values you list on the wall. It’s not what you say at an all-hands. It’s not your marketing campaign. It’s not even what you believe.
- It’s what you do. What you do is who you are. My new book aims to help you do the things you need to do so you can be who you want to be.

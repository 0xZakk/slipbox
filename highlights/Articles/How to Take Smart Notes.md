## Highlights

### Highlights

- in doing science and creative work, the objective is unclear until you've actually got there
- "slip-box"
- They have no value except as stepping stones towards making literature and permanent notes.
- These summarize the content of some text, and give the citation.
  
- Each permanent note contains one idea, explained fully, in complete sentences, as if part of a published paper.
- These are notes made only for a project, such as a note that collects all the notes that you'd want to assemble into a paper.
- Don't just read. Make reading notes. Don't just learn. Make blog posts or something to share what you learned.
- Put all these ideas in the same simple system of your slip-box, and you will be set free to use your biological brain to think about these ideas.
- Instead, you should write a lot of permanent notes in your slip-box. Then when the time comes for you to write a paper, just select a linear path out of the network of notes, then rephrase and polish that into a paper.
- Feedback loops should be short. It makes you learn fast, fail fast, succeed fast.
- this is how intuitive expertise is made: a lot of practice in an environment with rapid and unambiguous feedback.
- Don't multitask. Pay attention to one task at a time.
  
- The most important thing is to capture your understanding of the text, so don't quote.
- Recontexutalize ideas in your thought. Write down why you would care about an idea.
- The index note is just a list of tags/keywords with links.
- "entry points" to the topic.
- Between notes, there are two kinds of links: sequential and horizontal. 
- deally, you should make the network of slip-box notes to be like a small-world network, with a few notes having many connections, and some notes having "weak ties" to far-away notes
- Instead, do a walk through the slip-box and select a linear path. That gives you a draft from which you can polish into a paper.
  
- Don't brainstorm, since brainstormed ideas are what's easily available,

## Highlights

### Highlights

- When you follow somebody on Twitter, you agree to be brainwashed by their worldview, 280 characters at a time.
- Just as you pay attention to the food that enters your body, you should obsess over the ideas you allow into your mind.
- We live in the age of information abundance. Finding information is easier than ever, but filtering information is harder than ever. Whenever we open our phones, we are bombarded with irrelevant data and unsolicited stimulation. Like a buffet, choosing what to ignore is as important as choosing what to pay attention to.
- Find an account you like. Then scroll through their likes. As you do, look for accounts you haven’t heard of and scroll through their profiles. If you like what you see, follow them.
- As your Twitter feed grows, you’ll need to trim it.
- First, mute keywords. Way too many people on Twitter talk about politics which hurts the experience of the platform.
- Second, unfollow everybody who pollutes your feed. Every time you see a tweet that is petty, heartless, or aggressive, unfollow that person. As you do, your timeline will fill up with beauty and knowledge.

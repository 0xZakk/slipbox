- If there is one debate that is the endlessly circling “Star Wars versus Star Trek” of product development, it is what I refer to as “The Tradeoff Between Quality and Time” (TTBQT).
- You might think, But this is how it is. TTBQT is a necessary evil in building anything.
  But is it?
- But I’d like to propose a third option.
  When you get into a TTBQT state, the real question to ask is: “If we knew X would take this long to get to high-quality, would we have opted to do it in the first place?”
- This is a powerful question because it forces the team to examine what actually went wrong, which is typically:
  How ruthlessly the team has prioritized.
  How accurate the team’s estimates are around its ability to execute.
  How good the team is at actually executing.
- The second reason I like this question is because it helps to clarify what the TTBQT decision should be. If the answer is “No, X isn’t worth the time it’d take for us to make it high-quality” then cut Feature X altogether. Just stop working on it.
- It hurts to waste time and effort. We get attached to the things we work on. But that’s the Sunk Cost Fallacy talking. If you don’t think a feature is worth the time it takes to make it great, then it is not rational to ship a crappier version simply because you have sunk time into it.

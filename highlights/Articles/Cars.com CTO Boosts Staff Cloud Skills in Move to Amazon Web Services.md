- Cars.com LLC is retraining its information technology staff as the online vehicle marketplace shifts operations from co-located data centers to Amazon.com Inc.â€™s cloud service.
- The company offers subscription services to dealers that includes listings, access to reporting tools and intelligence such as pricing trends. The company expects operationally to be out of data centers and fully cloud-enabled by July.
- The shift can only happen as fast as staff are empowered to drive it, said Fred Lee, chief technology officer at the Chicago-based company, who was hired in 2018 to lead the move to the cloud.
- The company expects system improvements from AWS to result in webpages loading about 100% to 150% faster than before, with a 36-times improvement in image processing. The cloud also will help Cars.com expand the use of artificial intelligence to better match buyers with vehicles, he said.
- But first, Cars.com has had to remodel its technology staff.
- To ensure continuity during the transition and promote staff training in key cloud skills, Mr. Lee, who manages 350 employees, created two teams: one focused on maintaining the old data-center infrastructure, the other focused on the new cloud platform.
- About 20 data-center technical operations staff, including system administrators and database administrators, were given new roles and retrained in AWS tools, including the Elasticsearch and Aurora databases.
- Employees also were trained in programming languages such as Elixir, which is used to build cloud apps, and source-code management systems such as GitHub, which is being used in collaborative software development practices such as DevOps. Data-center staff were embedded with the team working on the cloud.
- The teams also worked to centralize data in an AWS data warehousing product called Redshift, a move expected to speed up website listing updates and expand the scope of reporting tools available to dealers, he said.
- When the new system goes live, dealers will know in real-time which vehicles are getting more attention and are more likely to sell based on price and market dynamics.
- The cloud-based tools also will enable dealers and inventory aggregation services to update listings and vehicle specifications, reducing hours spent by a Cars.com employee on such tasks by 95%.
- Cars.com will use its image-recognition tools on AWS to detect vehicle attributes such as trims and condition to increase the quality and accuracy of the listings for shoppers. That will save dealers time in manually updating their inventory listings, a company spokeswoman said.
- Richer multimedia and innovations such as 360-degree views and virtual reality are giving customers a better feel for cars and confidence in their buying decisions before going to dealerships, said Tyson Jominy, vice president of data and analytics consulting at JD Power, a research firm that tracks consumer behavior.

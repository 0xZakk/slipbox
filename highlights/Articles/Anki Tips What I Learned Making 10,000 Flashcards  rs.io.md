- Cards that answer the question “Why?” are more valuable than factual cards.
- It’s easy to memorize that QuickSort has a lower bound of O(n lg n), but better to know why it has such a lower bound, and even better still to understand why comparison-based sorts can’t be faster than O(n lg n).
- My emerging perspective here is that it’s important to understand all the context of an idea to really know it. How it emerged, how to invent it, what it’s for, and so on.
- My original Anki decks were all words. Now, I lean on images as heavily as possible.
- As an unintended consequence, my thought itself has shifted towards more imagery. The repetition makes an image representation of a concept more available mentally than its equivalent in words.
- Why questions
- Images
- Connections
- The biggest problem with Anki is the tendency for cards to become disconnected, so that a lot of knowledge is only available with the right cue and, even then, it’s a sort of impoverished thing.
- I’m not aware of any silver bullet for this problem, but I now construct more cards that enforce links between knowledge
- Single deck
- Currently, I have decks organized by topic and subtopic. However, I now think this is backwards. Given Hebbian learning — neurons that fire together wire together — I’m convinced that mixing everything is superior.
- Two-way connections
- Here’s a mistake I’ve made a couple of times. You’ll be reading a text and it’ll define something, like the Martin-Löf-Chaitin thesis, and you’ll create a card saying, “What’s the Martin-Löf-Chaitin thesis?”
  Then, sometime in your life, you’ll be sitting and thinking, “Hey, what’s that mathematical theory of randomness called?” and you won’t know, because you didn’t make a card like that, and your mind only learned the connection one way.
- In general, poor models of how memory and mind work hinder Anki effectiveness. You might think, hey, knowing something is all there is to knowing. Wrong. A lot of knowing is creating different cues and representations of that knowledge so that you can recall it when needed.
- A great deal of an effective knowledge base is engineering it so that it’ll be useful in the sort of situations where you expect to apply it.
- Adding whatever
- My philosophy when I started using Anki was to add whatever, to just adopt a trifling barrier to entry. I didn’t worry about whether a fact is useful or not or anything like that. If something appealed to me, I’d add it.
  This core is remains. The main change this philosophy has undergone is to shift away from setting a specific study time and making cards during that study time. Instead, I add anything interesting, regardless of when it happens, and random connections and insight that occur to me throughout the day.
- People also really like it when you can recall minutia about them, too, which is sort of fun. If someone mentions their favorite type of cheese, or a pet’s name, make it into an Anki card. It’s like free social points. Memorizing birthdays works.

## Highlights

### Highlights

- “The greatest obstacle to living is expectancy, which hangs upon tomorrow and loses today… The whole future lies in uncertainty: live immediately.”
-  “busy is a decision” 
- being productive is the surest way to lull ourselves into a trance of passivity and busyness the greatest distraction from living
- mistaking the doing for the being
- It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it.
- So it is: we are not given a short life but we make it short
- Life is long if you know how to use it.
- busyness — that dual demon of distraction and preoccupation — as an addiction 
- No activity can be successfully pursued by an individual who is preoccupied

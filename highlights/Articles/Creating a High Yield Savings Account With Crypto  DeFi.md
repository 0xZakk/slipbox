### Highlights

- In this post, I’ll go over what I think a good next step is: Using crypto to create a high-yield savings account
- What is a Savings Account
- A savings account is like a magic box that grows your fiat money. You park some cash in it, and in it pays you some interest in exchange. Or it used to anyway.
- But with cuts to the federal funds rate, those savings rates have dwindled. The current APY is only 0.10%, which means that at 2% inflation, you’re losing about 2% of your cash’s value by having it in a savings account each year. Boo.
- But traditional banks aren’t the only entities that will pay us interest for storing our money with them. There’s an emerging new world of “decentralized finance” (also called “DeFi”) we can tap into.
- What is Decentralized Finance
- Banks are centralized. There’s a board of directors, CEO, and employees who are deciding what happens with your money. Including whether or not you can even access it!
- Now that’s changing. With code and crypto technology, we can build a whole new suite of financial institutions that run on code instead of 24-year-olds. Instead of Topher from Dartmouth deciding whether or not you get a loan, software can automatically decide it for you.
- Coinbase IPO’d two weeks ago, and they’ve built an incredible crypto exchange that employs 1,200 people. But there’s another crypto exchange you might not know about: Uniswap, which does as much trading volume as Coinbase but only has 12 employees. Same throughput, 1/100th the employees. How? It’s a decentralized financial application.
- Compound is “an algorithmic, autonomous interest rate protocol.” For comparison, you might call Chase a “centralized, managed interest rate protocol.” Compound does the same lending processes we outlined earlier: paying interest on stored funds, and collecting interest on loaned funds, but they do it all with code instead of bankers. And they currently have about $15,500,000,000 in assets under management, about the same as Wealthfront.
- You can put money into Compound, and the protocol will pay you interest for storing your money there. And you can borrow money from it, which you’ll have to pay interest on. And just like with a normal bank, Compound makes money by charging more interest to borrowers than it pays to lenders.
- Here’s the big difference though. Compound is a decentralized autonomous application, so instead of the earnings being collected by the bank’s executives, the earnings are distributed to the people using the bank. This happens through a cryptocurrency that Compound continually mints and issues to their users called COMP, and which you can also buy and sell on Coinbase and other exchanges. As money is stored on Compound, new COMP tokens are created and paid out to users both on the Lend and Borrow side.
- So right now if you lend money to Compound, you currently earn 7.08% interest in dollars, but you also earn an extra 1.91% interest in COMP tokens. You’re earning interest on your dollars in dollars, but you’re also earning a bit of interest in the platform. Think of it like if you automatically earned JP Morgan Chase stock based on how much money you stored there.
- The system works because when you deposit money on Compound and stake it as collateral, Compound can automatically liquidate your collateral if you get overleveraged.
- But who’s using Compound to borrow money? And why would someone borrow money from Compound when they can go to a traditional bank? Because with Compound, there’s no approval process. As long as you’ve staked some amount of your crypto on Compound, you can borrow against that crypto, usually around 80% of the value of what you’ve staked.
  So if you join Compound and put up $10,000 of USDC as collateral, you can instantly borrow $8,000 of USDC. No questions asked. And you can repay it on whatever timeline you want, but you’ll keep accruing interest until you do.
- Setting Up Your DeFi “Savings Account”
- If you decide it’s something you want to try, start by taking whatever amount you want to save and use it to buy USDC on Coinbase.
- To transfer your USDC into Compound, you’ll need a browser wallet like MetaMask.
- Once your MetaMask is set up, you’ll be able to transfer your USDC from Coinbase to your MetaMask wallet. Then from there, all you need to do is go to app.compound.finance, click on USDC, and deposit your funds!
- Once your funds are deposited, you’ll start earning interest in both USDC and COMP. The USDC is automatically added to your USDC contribution, which means your interest is being constantly compounded. The COMP you’re earning gets tracked as a credit to your account, and when it gets to a big enough amount to justify paying the transaction fee to claim it, you’ll be able to collect the COMP you earned and either sell it or lend it to Compound to earn more interest.

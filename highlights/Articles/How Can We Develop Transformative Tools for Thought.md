- why is it that the technology industry has made comparatively little effort developing this vision of transformative tools for thought?
- In this essay we sketch out a set of ideas we believe can be used to help develop transformative new tools for thought.

- Seymour Papert
- Vannevar Bush
- But such veneration can veer into an unhealthy reverence for the good old days, a belief that giants once roamed the earth, and today's work is lesser. Yes, those pioneers did amazing things, and arguably had ways of working that modern technologists, in both industry and academia, are poorly equipped to carry on. But they also made mistakes, and were ignorant of powerful ideas that are available today. And so a theme through both parts of the essay is to identify powerful ideas that weren't formerly known or weren't acted upon. Out of this understanding arises a conviction that a remarkable set of opportunities is open today.
- a new medium for thought. A medium such as, say, Adobe Illustrator is essentially different from any of the individual tools Illustrator contains. Such a medium creates a powerful immersive context, a context in which the user can have new kinds of thought, thoughts that were formerly impossible for them.
- Speaking loosely, the range of expressive thoughts possible in such a medium is an emergent property of the elementary objects and actions in that medium. If those are well chosen, the medium expands the possible range of human thought.
- Iverson's Turing Award lecture, Notation as a Tool of Thought (1979).
- The musician and comedian Martin Mull has observed that “writing about music is like dancing about architecture”.
- The more transformative the tool, the larger the gap that is opened. Conversely, the larger the gap, the more difficult the new tool is to evoke in writing. But what writing can do, and the reason we wrote this essay, is act as a bootstrap. It's a way of identifying points of leverage that may help develop new tools for thought.
- What makes these subjects difficult? In fact, individually many of the underlying ideas are not too complicated for people with a technical background. But the ideas come in an overwhelming number, a tsunami of unfamiliar concepts and notation.
- But it's not a conventional essay. Rather, Quantum Country is a prototype for a new type of mnemonic medium. Aspirationally, the mnemonic medium makes it almost effortless for users to remember what they read.
- Is it possible to design a new medium which much more actively supports memorization?
- Of course, on its own this wouldn't make it trivial to learn subjects such as quantum mechanics and quantum computing – learning those subjects is about much more than memory. But it would help in addressing one core difficulty: the overwhelming number of new concepts and notation.
- how could you build a medium to better support a person's memory of what they read?
- mnemonic essays
- This takes advantage of a fundamental fact about human memory: as we are repeatedly tested on a question, our memory of the answer gets stronger, and we are likely to retain it for longer
- With the time taken to review a typical question being just a few seconds, that means a user can achieve long-term recall with no more than a few minutes' work.

- I strongly believe if you do one hard thing for 10 years in a row, you will achieve results far beyond your expectations.
- Don’t quit before giving your effort a chance to produce amazing results.
- Regular people get ahead all the time.
  
- There is absolutely nothing special about me. Not my looks. Not my intelligence. Not my physique. Not my wit. Not my writing. Not my voice. The only thing I do is keep on going.
- Grit is by far the most important attribute for achieving your goals. Don’t think you need to have some special attribute to get ahead. Who you are is good enough already.
- The great thing about doing something for 10+ years is that you will eventually catch some sort of “lucky break.” It is practically impossible to dedicate so much time to a craft and not get noticed by somebody.
  
- Success is a numbers game.
- When people see that you plan on sticking around for the long-term, they tend to give you more credibility. The more credibility you have, the more good things tend to happen.
- If you are getting criticized, know that what you are doing is making a difference.
- Criticism helps improve weaknesses and shines a spotlight on blindspots. Use criticism to get better and prove your critics wrong.
  
- You must believe in your mission. If you don’t, nobody else will. Do your best to see the positives in every situation.
- If you practice seeing the positive side in every situation, you will live a happier and more fulfilling life.
  
- Print out a reminder of one thing you must do each week. Do that one thing first before doing anything else. This is the same concept of paying yourself first before spending any money.
- ‘You don’t want to win an argument. You want to win.”
  
- just spend time living your life exactly the way you want.
- The more you give, the more you will get. Too many people ask first and then (maybe) give. Plenty of people just take, take, take.
  
- You cannot expect to be universally loved. Therefore, do not try to please everyone.
- You can always find ways to minimize or solve your pain points to help you focus.
- If you have nagging problems, stop letting inertia force you to do things the way they’ve always been done. Take some time to see if you can do things differently.
- Stop feeling like you need to be perfect in order to launch. There is no such thing as perfect.
  
- If you have a competitive advantage, you can last far longer than those who don’t. Be honest about your strengths and weaknesses.
  
- Do what you’re good at and outsource tasks in areas where you lack interest and expertise.
  
- After about three years of working on your craft, if you’re not getting better or growing, you’ve got to change your approach.
  
- When it comes to growing a business, if you’re not growing the way you want, you’re simply not adding enough value. Find new ways to add value.
  
- The more grateful you are, the more you will appreciate what you have. The more you appreciate what you have, the harder you will work because you will never take what you have for granted.
  
- Knowing your why will help keep you focused.
  
- Money is a difficult primary motivation to have. Money will disappoint you because it will either never feel like enough or you will be sad when you realize money doesn’t make you happier once you reach your financial goals.
- You can do more than you think. It’s only after challenging yourself to the extreme will you realize your true abilities.
  
- My one motto in life is, “Never fail due to a lack of effort because effort requires no skill.”
- Your ultimate goal should be to be proud of your effort.

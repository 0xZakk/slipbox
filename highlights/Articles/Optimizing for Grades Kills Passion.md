- "The most damaging thing you learned in school wasn't something you learned in any specific class. It was learning to get good grades." - Paul Graham
- “A hundred years ago, you needed a factory & thousands of workers to start a company. Today, you just need to open your laptop.”
- "At the heart of what makes the “growth mindset” so winsome, Dweck found, is that it creates a passion for learning rather than a hunger for approval"
- Over-optimizing for a grade or test score kills this passion. It forces you into a mindset where you have to “hack the test” to win.
  Chasing higher grades in school translates to chasing a higher salary as an adult.
  You go to work to make money, not because you enjoy the work. But when it's your passion, you take the initiative to add your own improvisations and inventions.
- I’ve been recently fascinated by “Shuhari”—a Japanese martial arts concept. It breaks down into three stages:
- Shu (守) - traditional wisdom. The student follows the guidance of their teacher precisely. The focus is not on the underlying theory, but how to do the task at hand.
- Ha (破) - breaking with tradition. Then, the student digs into the principles behind the technique. She starts integrating insights from other teachers into her own practice.
- Ri (離) - transcendence. Now, the student develops her own theory. She can design different techniques to suit her particular circumstances.
- Real breakthroughs only happen when you transcend consensus thinking (Ri).

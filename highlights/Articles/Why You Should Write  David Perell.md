- Words are the atomic unit of the internet.
- Writing online is a guaranteed way to shrink the world. A well-written article can change your life because the internet rewards people who think well.
- As Derek Sivers once wrote: “the coolest people I meet are the ones who find me through something I’ve written.”
- Writing is like weightlifting for the brain. Testing the limits of your ideas is the fastest way to improve them and raise your intelligence. 
- While most people throw stones, writers move mountains.
  
- Writers engage with reality like it’s a full-contact sport. It’s a collision between your mind and the world.
- Writing initiates the ultimate positive feedback loop. Online writers are rewarded with instant feedback, and fast feedback loops are the best way to accelerate your learning.
- Better yet, writing regularly will inspire you to live an interesting life. As your writing improves, so will the opportunities available to you.
- "If you wish you would take something more seriously, do it publicly… Social pressure forces you to up your game.”
- The only thing standing between you and your writing goals is discipline.

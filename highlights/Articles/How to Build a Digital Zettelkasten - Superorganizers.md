- It’s like compound interest: if you put a dollar in a savings account today, over a lifetime, that dollar will create many more dollars for you. Likewise, in a Zettelkasten, the more notes you add, the more the value of each individual note compounds.
- A Zettelkasten is like an interest-paying savings account for your mind.
- However, today we have software and computers. They give us a few advantages over notecards:
- Search. Searching through a box of physical cards is tedious. It’s much easier to type in a search bar.
- Linking. Links in a physical Zettelkasten are equivalent to hyperlinks online. Computers make links clickable and the underlying information accessible in an instant (so speed is an advantage, too).
- Storage. If you’re going to index a lifetime of knowledge on notecards, you’re eventually going to need a lot of space for boxes. It’s a little easier if you keep this information on the internet, where you can get to it from your laptop or phone, or any device anywhere in the world.
- Roam is a note-taking tool designed for networked thought. In contrast to a file structure on a computer (or with Evernote and Notion), in Roam you link thoughts together at the idea level. It encourages you to think topically instead of linearly.
- Its first benefit is bi-directional linking. You can instantly make a word its own page, and easily flip between pages with a single click.
- Finally, the cognitive friction to tag and link concepts together is very low. The keyboard shortcuts make it quick and there’s not really a cost to linking too many concepts or linking the wrong concepts.

- In 2019, I had a few hundred Twitter followers. In 2020, I reached 30,000 Twitter followers in just a few months. Thanks to building an audience first, my book made over $30,000 and sold over 1500 copies.
- It was difficult to get my first product out there but the feeling of selling your first product online is indescribable. Focus on just getting your first product out there.
- ## Selecting The Topic
- I started writing the book early in 2020 before the pandemic. I had some difficulty choosing a topic. I would write a few pages on one topic idea and then decide that I didn’t want to do that idea and switch again

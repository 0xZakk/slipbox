# Why to Start a Startup in a Bad Economy

## Meta Data

- The economic situation is apparently so grim that some experts fear we may be in for a stretch as bad as the mid seventies.
  When Microsoft and Apple were founded.
- October 2008
- As those examples suggest, a recession may not be such a bad time to start a startup. I'm not claiming it's a particularly good time either. The truth is more boring: the state of the economy doesn't matter much either way.
- If we've learned one thing from funding so many startups, it's that they succeed or fail based on the qualities of the founders.
- The economy has some effect, certainly, but as a predictor of success it's rounding error compared to the founders.
  Which means that what matters is who you are, not when you do it.
- So if you want to improve your chances, you should think far more about who you can recruit as a cofounder than the state of the economy. And if you're worried about threats to the survival of your company, don't look for them in the news. Look in the mirror.
- Technology progresses more or less independently of the stock market. So for any given idea, the payoff for acting fast in a bad economy will be higher than for waiting.
- Of course, the idea you have now won't be the last you have. There are always new ideas. But if you have a specific idea you want to act on, act now.
- Fortunately the way to make a startup recession-proof is to do exactly what you should do anyway: run it as cheaply as possible.
- The immediate cause of death in a startup is always running out of money. So the cheaper your company is to operate, the harder it is to kill. And fortunately it has gotten very cheap to run a startup. A recession will if anything make it cheaper still.
- Another advantage of bad times is that there's less competition. Technology trains leave the station at regular intervals. If everyone else is cowering in a corner, you may have a whole car to yourself.
- So maybe a recession is a good time to start a startup. It's hard to say whether advantages like lack of competition outweigh disadvantages like reluctant investors. But it doesn't matter much either way. It's the people that matter. And for a given set of people working on a given technology, the time to act is always now.

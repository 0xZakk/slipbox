- According to a 2013 Harvard Business Review survey of 12,000 professionals, half of the respondents said their job had no meaning and significance.
- The Internet swallows up an increasing percentage of our leisure time, but people under-estimate the economic opportunities it presents — even for college seniors. First, I discovered a better way to find a job. Then, I used the Internet to build my business. What follows is the three-step process I’ve used to create professional opportunities online.
- My method of “Audience-First Products” is still experimental, but I believe it’s repeatable. It’s a new way to test the feasibility of a business idea. It stands in stark contrast to the “old guard” model of attending job fairs, working mindless jobs to learn professional skills, and raising money before you start a business. Just like the job fair, there is a better way to start a business.
- Here’s the three-step process I used to capitalize on the transition to the online economy:
  (1) build an audience
  (2) build a product
  (3) scale the solution
- Step 1: Build an Audience:
- Before the Internet, companies built products before audiences. Now, they build audiences before products.
- Having an audience will give you a unique perspective on the world. You’ll receive instant, high-quality feedback on the ideas you share. People are taught to hunt down interesting people, ideas, and opportunities. But masters of the Internet attract them. Sharing ideas attracts like-minded people, who double as a feedback loop to make you smarter and more interesting.
- As you build your Audience-First Product, focus on resonance instead of scale. Most online metrics focus on how many people you reach, not the depth of relationships you build with them.
- Define your own intersection of ideas by writing about topics nobody else is writing about, and putting a name to your perspective. When you write about a specific topic, you’ll find common challenges which double as areas of entrepreneurial opportunity.
- Step 2: Build a Product:
- Once you’ve built an audience, you can focus on the second step of delivering a product to them. There are problems everywhere. Nearly every service could be delivered with more joy, in a more efficient manner. Study any industry for long enough and you’ll find ways to improve it.
- To build a product, you should solve a problem for your audience or yourself — ideally both.
- Regardless, the bigger the overlap between the audience you attract and the product you sell, the more successful you’ll be.
- If people are continuously annoyed about something, there’s an opportunity to build a product. If an obvious customer pain point hasn’t been solved, there’s probably a reason why. But you’ll find economic opportunities in common problems people don’t know they have.
- Step 3: Scale with Software and Contractors
- If you define your processes, you don’t have to hire full-time employees. Depending on their complexity, you can outsource repeatable processes to personal assistants and software programs.
- The robots are already here. But they’re packed in Northern Virginia data centers, and don’t look like the human-style robots we saw in iRobot. Automate processes with code whenever possible. If you know how to code, you can build your own software. If you don’t, you can automate repeatable processes with tools like Zapier.
- If you can’t automate a process with software, you can delegate it with contractors and personal assistants. They prefer well-defined projects and enjoy the repetitive tasks that drain the energy of an entrepreneur’s soul. As you work with them, ask them to refine and add detail to every process. The more granular the checklist, the better.
- This three-step process removes some of the risks of entrepreneurship without reducing the benefits to society.
- We’ve reached a tipping point for the creation of online businesses. First, it’s easier than ever to build an online audience. Future customers can find you on social media, stay connected with you through email, and build a relationship with you through articles and podcasts. Second, the number of no-code, plug-and-play software tools has exploded in the past five years. They’re almost all cheap to use at first, and the costs only rise as your business grows.
- Avoiding competition is the best way to build an Audience-First Product. You must solve problems other people aren’t trying to solve. Do something unique. Don’t be the 800th person to sell T-shirts on Instagram. When in doubt, don’t differentiate on branding or packaging either. The world doesn’t need another copycat product, and your compensation will reflect that.

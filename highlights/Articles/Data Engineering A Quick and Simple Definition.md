- What does wrangling involve? Data Wrangling with Python authors Katharine Jarmul and Jacqueline Kazil explain the process in their book:
  Data wrangling is about taking a messy or unrefined source of data and turning it into something useful. You begin by seeking out raw data sources and determining their value: How good are they as data sets? How relevant are they to your goal? Is there a better source? Once youâ€™ve parsed and cleaned the data so that the data sets are usable, you can utilize tools and methods (like Python scripts) to help you analyze them and present your findings in a report. This allows you to take data no one would bother looking at and make it both clear and actionable.
- Data engineers make sure the data the organization is using is clean, reliable, and prepped for whatever use cases may present themselves. Data engineers wrangle data into a state that can then have queries run against it by data scientists.

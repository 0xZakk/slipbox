- People aren't deliberate enough about choosing what to work on.
  To paraphrase the words of John O'Donohue, we are blind to the complacency that passes for ambition in modern society.
- New ideas are fragile. Since they originate in the messy madness of intuition and the fringes of society, they don't carry the crisp edges that rational critics look for. Forgetting this, we beat precious but unconventional ideas out of people before they have time to blossom.
- Right now, in order to do something truly innovative, you need to drop out of the system entirely or be so independent-minded that people call you a lunatic. In a time when it's easier than ever to start a company, we should encourage people to identify the important problems society ignores and find scalable solutions to them — all while making a truck-load of profit.
- Broadly, there are five buckets that talented people should start companies around: energy, education, housing, healthcare, and transportation. That’s because the western world has stagnated on all five fronts. For every sector except energy and sometimes housing, costs are rising faster than the rate of inflation.
- Paradoxically, ambitious and differentiated goals are sometimes easier to achieve than mundane ones. Ambitious people attract other ambitious people. In positive-sum areas, they find ways to work together and help each other. That's why inspiring goals make it easier to hire, raise money, and meet the kinds of people who can move the world with a single phone call.

- I’m still googling the simplest things, hopping from one StackOverflow question to the next, asking myself why the heck I can’t remember basic R syntax. Everything I want to do takes forever, and I’m wondering if I’m just too dumb for this.
- The reason I’m making exactly zero progress is simple. I can’t write R code. Not fluently, at least.
- Anki is a flashcard program that algorithmically determines the point in time where you’re most likely to forget something and tests you on it, which makes that fact stick longer in your memory.
- Unfortunately, using Anki itself never stuck, so I was never as successful using it as I could have been. But I knew how incredibly powerful it could be, so I spent two days setting up Anki again and putting every function on this Data Wrangling Cheatsheet into it.
  And then…magic happened. Within a week, I wrote code from memory. I didn’t have to look up how to transform a data frame from wide to long format, how to select only certain rows or remove columns that I didn’t need.
  I wrote R code like it was normal text!
- In this guide I’ll show you how you too can flip that switch and write R code like it’s nothing.
- remembering is a choice, that
  you can control what you can recall at a moments notice.
- The one thing these essays don’t talk about as much is implementing spaced repetition. So that’s what I want to do here. Show you that you are able to learn writing R code, and that you can learn to write R fast. The one thing this does require is consistency, but we’ll return to that a bit later.
- The Tool: Setting Up Anki
- The basis for taking full advantage of Spaced Repetition is Anki.
- With Anki installed, you will need to install two other things, two Anki Add-ons:
  Mini Format Pack
  Syntax Highlighting for Code
- The Skill: How To Make Good Flashcards To Learn Programming
- To help you make the most out of your time using Anki and to really write R code fluently I want to share a couple of tips and strategies with you that have helped me tremendously.
  The first one is to trust the system.
- Spaced Repetition and Anki work, really work, if you follow the system. It’s been scientifically proven, and even though you might think “this is just rote memorization, this is bad”, it is not.
- Rules 1 and 2: “Do not learn if you do not understand” and “Learn before you memorize”.
- This is particularly important when learning programming. You need a good understanding of what the code, the functions, and the rules you are learning do and are used for.
- nki is a tool for remembering things you haved learned, not for learning things you’ve never seen before.
- Rule 3 and 4: “Build upon the basics” and “Stick to the minimum information principle”.
- You do not need to have read and understood all of Hadley Wickhams “Advanced R” before you start memorizing things.
- On the contrary, start memorizing tiny facts that you have understood. Make the most basic behaviors of R so automatic that you forget that you ever needed to learn them.
- Rule 5: “Cloze deletion is easy and effective”.
- Cloze deletion is when you are shown a sentence with a part missing and replaced by dots, which you then have to remember. Cloze deletion is essential for learning R.
- By looking at code and identifying what’s missing, you build an essential skill for a programmer and memorize code in its actual real-world context where you want to use it.
- 1. You have to type your answers.
- Anki is great in that it not only lets you use cloze deletions, but also provides the option to type the answer to the clozes. This is critical for any programming-related memorization.
- 2. Give an explicit task and provide all necessary information.
- So, make cards that ask you to do a concrete task with a concrete solution.
- Example - How to Create New Flashcards for R in Anki
- I’ve created a sample collection of cards, including a custom card type for you to reuse with your own cards, that you can download here.
- From the drop-down menu that says Basic, select the note type Programming - Typing:
- The Practice: Sticking To Your Ankis
- Using Anki can be your secret weapon, the magical tool in your belt to not only learn to finally be fluent in R, but to learn literally anything.
- There is only one thing you have to do: do your Ankis every day.
- It takes ~10-20min per day, depending on how much knowledge you choose to put into it.

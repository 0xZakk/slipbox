All men have a mission. They need one. Without a mission, men wander around aimlessly, feeling useless. And, in fact, you are useless. Men (just like women) have a responsibility to this planet and it's through their mission that they accept and perform that responsibility.

The question to ask is, "Why are you doing this?" Battling for your sovereignty is hard -- really hard. Why are you going to do it in the first place?

The reward is the feeling of doing what you were born to do. But you need to figure out what it is you were born to do in the first place. What's your mission?

# DAO Primitives

Accounting Software
- What is the QuickBooks for DAOs?

Cloud Software
- What are the S3, EC2, and SQS for DAOs?

I think a lot of people are looking at the present and seeing two things: treasury, communication/coordination, and voting. What their missing by looking at the present is that these problems are likely already solved well-enough.

A couple of companies have raised a ton of money to tackle these big problems and I wish them well, but they're probably too late. No one really likes having their community on Discord, but good luck getting anyone to change. It's pretty entrenched. It's not perfect, but it's good enough and communicating is a means to an end for every DAO. It took us an hour to set up a token-gated discord community for CabinDAO. We've talked about changing but we probably never will. At this point, we're in the phase where something would have to be 10-100x better than Discord for us to seriously *consider* migrating. The same is true for Snapshot (voting) and Gnosis (treasury).

The primitives I see:

1. Crowdfund
2. Token generator / central bank
3. Swap / Exchange
4. Liquidity Pool

If you're active in the DAO/Web3 community, you're probably underwhelmed by that list and that's kind of the point. We forget, but no one was blown away when AWS launched with S3, EC2, and SQS. They didn't invent these things and they weren't the first people to put these things on the cloud. They were the first to be good and flexible and unopinionated. And that's what we need next. Good, flexible, unopinionated primitives abstracted away behind a user interface.

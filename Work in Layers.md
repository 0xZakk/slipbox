# Work in Layers

My high-school art teacher shared a critique of my work that has stuck with me ever since: work in layers.

I was a relatively prolific painter in high-school and my favorite thing to paint and draw were candid portraits. The biggest challenge I had was getting the proportions to my work right. I'd get to the end of a painting session and feel like I'd gotten one section of the canvas to a good spot, only to find it didn't look right with the rest.

I observed this and so did my art teacher. The issue, she pointed out, was one of process: you can't actually focus in on a single section of a painting because you lose sight of the rest of the canvas. It seems obvious in retrospect and it was great advice. The solution is to learn how to improve one section of the canvas while keeping the whole canvas in view.

In the 15 years since I first heard that advice, I've seen it play out in a lot of different ways. Barbara Oakley suggests learning the high level concepts of a domain before diving deep into a specific area, but always keep the higher level concepts in mind. In business, it's called the Theory of Constraints: optimize for the global maxima instead of a local one.

Wherever you are, work in layers.

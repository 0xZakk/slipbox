Benjamin Franklin's 13 Virtues is a perfect example of a code of conduct, something every man needs. With a personal code of conduct, you are able to conduct yourself in any situation or environment. It'll also be important to know if you're winning the battle for your sovereignty. Are you living up to your Code of Conduct? If so, then you're winning the fight -- keep fighting.

## Virtues of A Sovereign Man

### Self-Reliance

While it's perfectly alright to ask for and accept help, a [[ðŸŸ¨ Sovereign Man]] is one who tries to help himself first. 

Many men today depend on others - emotionally and physically. This manifests in their inability to take care of things themselves and the common characteristic of blaming others for their problems. It makes sense. It's easier to depend on others and it's easier to blame others than to face the facts. But a Sovereign Man is self-reliant.

### Intentionality

One of the ways that men give up their sovereignty is by not being intentional about how they spend their time and energy. They start down a path and are conditioned by it to the point that it becomes a habit they can't break: wake up, go to work, come home, cook dinner, go to sleep.

A Sovereign Man looks at his time and is deliberate about how he spends it.

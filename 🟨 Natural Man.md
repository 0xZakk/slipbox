The opposite of the [[ðŸŸ¨ Sovereign Man | Sovereign Man]] is the Natural Man.

The Natural Man is what you see in most men today. Someone who is weak and doesn't feel the need to become stronger. Someone who has to ask for permission to do anything. Someone who doesn't want to work, but feels owed and entitled the benefits. Someone who doesn't want to take responsibility for anything, including their own life.

Unfortunately, the Natural Man is inside of us all. In order to become a Sovereign Man, you must battle the Natural Man.

The first step to becoming a Sovereign Man is recognizing the Natural Man inside you. While it's true that the cards are stacked against men in many ways today, the reality is that, more often than not, the biggest obstacle in your way is yourself. For all the challenges that men face, we tend to be our own worst enemy.

## Summary:

Everything in your life -- the state of your finances, the success of your business, the health of your body and relationships -- is your fault. Being a Sovereign Man is about taking responsibility for these things. 

Every man has a vision for his life, but very few men have the courage and grit to make that vision a reality. At a minimum, every man must perform three roles: protector, provider, and presider. These three roles form the foundation of being a Sovereign Man. Beyond that, a man must live by a code of conduct that he defines.

The goal of this book is to help you recapture your sovereignty (become a Sovereign Man), to live by a code of conduct and live into your roles as protector, provider, and presider.

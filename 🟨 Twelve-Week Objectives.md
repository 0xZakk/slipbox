The objectives you set in pursuit of your [[ðŸŸ¨ Vision]] should be set in twelve-week increments.

Twelve weeks is long enough to make meaningful progress on an objective and to make a measurable difference in your life. It's also short enough to keep your attention and focus.

For each area of [[ðŸŸ¨ The Four Quadrants]], you should set one twelve-week objective.
